Bjela did a great job like with Montevideo. There is a murder, twists, suspects, there are Cozacs from Russia, VMRO from Macedonia, there are Germans, Serbs and a few more interesting groups. If I can compare this one with something famous it will be Peaky Blinders for sure. My recommendations to everyone."

I regularly watch Foreign language TV through Walter Presents on Channel 4, Netflix and Amazon Prime and this rates as one of the best series I have seen. Central European politics of the 1920s is totally unknown to English speaking audiences so the storyline is fresh and the world of the Belgrade underworld unknown. Itis reminiscent of Peaky Blinders and fans of that will enjoy this fix as like there the actions and experiences of the First World War motivate the actions of many of the characters and unfinished business fuels the plotline. Well worth a box set binge"

Having a little historical background helps (the fraternal connection between Tsarist Russia and Serbia for example) but is not required. Violence, international intrigue. street level gangs, soldiers still dealing with the aftermath of WW1, new forensic science, independence fighters/terrorists, opium fueled hedonism/social decay all come together to make an amazingly enjoyable binge watch. The acting is great. A must watch for fans of The Wire and Peaky Blinders. It is hard at first to keep some of the characters straight in your head, but it gets easier as the show progresses."

      "content": "If you're looking for a historically accurate depiction of Yugoslavia between world wars, you're in a wrong place. However, if you're looking for a crime thriller in which actual historical figures play important roles, then this might be interesting.In terms of story and production values (\"look and feel\") this is the most accomplished TV show from Serbia in well over a decade. It has an ambitious plot playing on several levels.The only thing that bothered me was the choice of language, which seems to be a conscious decision in Serbian cinema and, for that matter, in the whole former Yugoslavia. At a certain point I've realized that the F-word and it's derivatives constitute a good part of the script. The Serbian language is particularly creative in this area, but even that didn't help in the long run.To be clear, I'm not complaining that a wealthy socialite in the show might use the vocabulary of the lowest social strata. Although i find it highly unlikely, my thoughts on the topic have been covered in my comment above that this is not a documentary. What I mean is that there are scenes where, instead of writing a generic dialogue, the writer(s) opted for profanities. This I can attribute solely to lazy script writing..."

      "title": "This is how world-class level TV Series should look like",
      "content": "I am very demanding as audience about Movies and especially TV Series, because they last longer and take more of viewers time. What I always hated in TV Series is the pace, plot is usually unfolding slower than it should, and there are always numerous filler characters and subplots that are only there to prolong series run-time. After watching 7 episodes of \"Senke nad Balkanom\", I can be sure that this wasn't just lucky shot with the pilot episode, the series is expanding, developing and becoming even better and better. Each episode brings us new plot twists and complications that are not forced, they emerge from character relations and events that have happened in previous episodes. They are somehow logical, natural and fluid with the main story-line, yet they are unexpected. Nothing is predictable in the series and that is absolutely amazing. Those screenwriters done their job right this time. Characters - there are no \"filler\" characters. Whoever takes screen time, it will have it's importance and impact on the plot, sooner or later. Sex scenes and secret love affairs - those are not there only for nudity. Every affair has its own impact on the story. I am absolutely amazed how every character is a piece of a puzzle that is coming together in such a perfect way. Every subplot is interesting on its own, but how subplots are intertwined is what is fascinating (perfection of that can be compared with Westworld series, season 1). And all of that put together in a historical frame. This is what historical fiction is all about, this is how historical fiction should look like. I can only hope that Dragan Bjelogrlic will keep up the good work. This is his Magnum opus and I hope that this series can become international hit, can pay off and enable Dragan Bjelogrlic to finish all planned 3 seasons at this quality level."

Not only did he raise the bar, he also fueled the production of other awesome Serbian production tv shows( Beleznica profesora Miskovica and Kalkanski Krugovi being a prime example). As for the show itself, it focuses on political games and underground of post-WWI Belgrade and Yugoslavia. It's not historically accurate but it's interesting take on the history of Balkan Peninsula. Show is full of awesome, believable plot-twists, interesting characters(the main trio is just superb) and the production values are equal to HBO, Netflix... Some of these big corps should give a lot of money to Bjelogrlic because he showed here that he can make a captivating, interesting, quality tv-show with not that much money. Just imagine what he can do with a true big budget."

Storyline is interesting and pushes you into further thinking about what's really going on and what is going to happen next. I was also happy to see very good special effects. There were some nudity, and other explicit scenes, so this show reminds of the Game of Thrones series in a way, of course it's not recommended for children even though it has been broadcast in the prime time of the national television. I would only complain on not-so-witty jokes and poor acting by some of the cast. Overall, I give this show 8/10."

This should be one of the best show in the world...hope the 3.

Leona Paraminski, Nebojsa Dugalic suprised me in a great way cause i haven't saw her much, German, French language speaking, Maja Bergam also and not just that but changing accents were perfect because I know it's not easy to do that I was working a job where I was all around the Balkan so I learned and maybe had in in me but my friends can't shift accents how hard they tried so I'm not he POINT the point is Leona, Bojan Navojec, Nebojsa Dugalic with foreign language speaking! Gordan Kicic was a psycho for an Emmy, Golden Globe and which statue is in play.....Andrija Kuzmanovic also! All of them were best in their role not one of them sticks out wrongly!"

The station more well know for repeats and re runs.It is the highest watched show over the entire UK Gold network and for a very good reason. For not only does the show keep itself fresh with 5 new faces every season but the kameradory between Greg and Little Alex Horne never goes stale.Deffo worth watching box set to box set"

(Checking on Knappit, hugging Katherine R., the bond with Asim)I like the way they all take criticism & the way they put their all into things. That Alex considers feedback and adapts to it instead of ignoring it. (The stage tie task stands out for that, and made me feel even more stoked on TM.)I can't decide whether the best bit is seeing how different people's brains work as they come up with task solutions, or trying to imagine how you would do the same task (yourself or with friends).Fave season so far is Acaster's, but it's a testament to the awesomeness of this show that it's so hard to pick!"

As 4 On Demand have Taskmaster from series 1, I opted to watch from the beginning. I regularly find I'm laughing so much it hurts. There are indeed, many eggs, loads of balloons and several frying pans."

Each series has had at least one brilliant guest and the tasks are usually amazing and bring out amazing insights into the competitors minds, which in some cases is scary!Overall, I love each episode and often laugh out loud on numerous occasions. I recommend this to anyone because it can appeal to anyone, regardless of age etc."

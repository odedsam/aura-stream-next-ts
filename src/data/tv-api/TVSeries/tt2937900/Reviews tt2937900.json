It seems like it's all natural lighting in most scenes which makes it beautiful and authentic. And the real gem..Clive Owen. He was born to play Thackeray. The knick is an incredible series with too real medical scenes that I warn you can be hard for the weak stomachs. The second season has been just as good as the first. This is a must watch with an excellent cast and acting. The procedures are phenomenal and awe inspiring. Do your self a favor and watch this incredible show"

      "title": "Gripping portrayal of life – and death – in and around a New York hospital at the turn of the 20th. Century",
      "content": "Wow. This new show certainly knows how to get your attention. Within the first five minutes of the first episode you will have a very clear picture of what it meant to have to undergo surgery at a time when even today's most common surgical procedures had hardly been tested – let alone successfully. With this new series, writers Jack Amiel and Michael Begler have created a fascinating – and gripping – look at the humble beginnings of modern medicine, and frankly: it made me realize just how lucky I am to live today. The show's title is derived from the 'Knickerbocker Hospital', a fictional hospital at the turn of the 20th. century in New York which serves as the centre stage around which the lives and struggles of the protagonists revolve. 'The Nick' shows us an uneasy, turbulent time where everything is in motion, and although the benefits of the so called \"modern age\" are already waiting around the corner, the situation for people without money is grim. Immigrants live in horrible sanitary situations, little children have to work in factories and social frictions and racial prejudice run deep within society.Clive Owen does an excellent job portraying a conflicted but passionate surgeon who's constantly trying to push the boundaries by inventing or refining surgical methods in the hope of lowering the mortality rate among his patients. The rest of the cast is also terrific; their performances - along with the great writing - help create a sense of realism that is rarely seen in films or TV-shows depicting that era. The same can be said of the fantastic production values – the team behind 'The Knick' obviously went to great lengths to portray everyday life of that era as accurately as possible. Virtually every frame oozes quality: the city of New York at the beginning of the twentieth century has been meticulously recreated and every busy street corner, alley or candle-lit room feels authentic. Small wonder, perhaps, given that the director, producer, cinematographer and editor of all 20 episodes is none other than multi-talent and Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh.My verdict: This is a fascinating, gripping portrayal of the dawn of modern surgery as well as an intense human drama and an authentic look at an era we normally only get to see in films about Sherlock Holmes or Jack the Ripper. Highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

      "content": "I'm surprised that this Cinemax series wasn't more successful. It has everything going for it like solid writing, acting, and high quality production. Set in 1900 New York City, the Knick is short for the Knickerbocker hospital. Just like other businesses, hospitals have to make a profit and survive. The Knick is a 1900 version of St. Elsewhere about a struggling hospital. The first season has ten episodes starring Clive Owen as Dr. Thackeray, a renowned surgeon and secret drug addict. Andre Holland plays Dr. Algernon Edwards, an African American surgeon trained at Harvard and worked in Europe before coming to the Knick. Juliet Rylance plays Cornelia Robertson, the hospital administrator and daughter of its owner. Cara Seymour plays a nun with quite a secret that you won't see coming with complexity and devotion. The rest of the cast is stellar but I can't name them all here. Eve Hewson is perfect as the West Virginia transplanted nurse who knows and protects Thackeray. This series is almost flawless and perfect but I can't understand why I didn't see or know about it before. This series deserved some respect and accolades like other series."

      "title": "For your weekly drama remedy, look no further than The Knick, an oasis of medical and social intellect. Side effects might vary, including addiction.",
      "content": "I would not imagine that a series equivalent to unholy alliance of House and Sherlock would be on Cinemax. The Knick is a collection of dysfunctional characters that roam the street of last century New York, dressed as doctors, nurses, and even high class patrons. It's an utter delight to see their shenanigans as well as depravities. This is the period of obviousness, medical advancement, racial profiling and all of these are presented like Sherlock with morphine overdose.Everyone is flawed here, even if their motive might be just, the moral ambiguity plagued any on-screen persona. Clive Owen plays as Dr. Thackery, the head surgeon of the less profitable partial altruistic hospital The Knick. I can't imagine Clive Owen without the stache anymore, this is a character with such determination that the only drive rivaling it is his addiction. Other notable character is Dr. Edwards by Andre Holland who's a brilliant colored doctor who must deal with racism and his own vices.The pace wastes no time to introduce many subplots and characters. It's rare that nearly every perspective is appealing. On other series they have strong leads and probably one or two well written supporting cast. This is not so with The Knick, audience would find something endearing in the unorthodox characters as they all have their unique slightly destructive charm.With Steven Soderbergh at helm, the artistic vibe just oozes from the dirty New York. Continuous scenes happen so often that they can adsorb audience in the immersive atmosphere. The soundtracks are intriguingly contagious, they are modernized version of old school tune. It's strange, catchy and really set up the quirky mood. Furthermore, it has some of the most convincing practical effects for anatomical and cringe purpose.The Knick is a top shelf drama, administered with style and not only embracing all of its undesirable oddities, but put them in proud display."

      "content": "Wow, what a dark and disturbing series, and it's excellent. The racism portrayed on The Knick is worse than that in 12 Years a Slave, but it takes place in NYC around the turn of the 20th Century. Even the \"heroes,\" the smart ones, are racists, although they gradually overcome prejudice when presented with a Model Negro, the brilliant surgeon and inventor portrayed by Andre Holland. But every black person in the city is one wrong move away from lynching by the Irish cops and the Irish populace. And that's just one theme: the hospital portrayed in The Knick is in the forefront of surgical innovation, mostly advances in stanching bleeding while sewing up internal injuries. There are lots of shots of internal organs and blood oozing out of human bodies, more gruesome than anything I've ever seen. (The show strives for accuracy in its portrayal of medical history.) The lead surgeon, portrayed by Clive Owen, performs miracles while addicted to every drug available in the hospital and in Chinatown, where he spends all his off-duty time. It's a powerful show, and the only reason why I continue to subscribe to Cinemax. The show is created and often directed by genius Steven Soderburgh. And it's filmed in New York, which gives it greater authenticity. And an electronic music score mesmerizes."

      "title": "The Knick",
      "content": "The Knick is a television show anyone interested in very relevant topics of our day should not miss. On the exterior, The Knick is a historical look at early 1900's New York City and the plot is based around a newly promoted head surgeon, Dr. Thackery (Clive Owen), of The Knickerbocker Hospital. The medical aspect of the show is truly fascinating, intense and shocking. The surgeries shown on the show are not for the faint of heart and have the look of a butcher shop rather then what we currently expect in an operating room. The sets are beautiful and well done to portray a century year old time period. I have heard complaints about the music and blurry vision of some of the cameras and shots that Director Steven Soderbergh incorporates throughout the show. If you want a clean cut narrative with perfectly clean shots and no unique sound, then feel free to go watch network television. I find the electronic music very interesting and almost a sort of heart beat to the show. The blurry shots are absolutely justified as this world is dimly lit and fuzzy on its own accord. The music and cinematography do it great justice.The acting on the show is also top notch as Clive Owen leads a team that is in sync throughout. Andre Holland is a revelation as Dr. Algernon Edwards, a African American doctor literally fighting for respect in an extremely racist medical world. These two characters and their relationship form the essence of much of the show's themes which are very relevant even today. Beneath each character there lies more depth then you will receive in most television. Dr Thackery is burdened by his past and his temptations, yet is dedicated to saving the lives of his patients and not selling out. It is a gray world at The Knick and one in which lies death, drugs, sex, racism and deceit, and at the same time brings us heroics, ethics, humanity and discovery."

The show is about discovering new techniques of surgery and medicine at the turn of the 20th century. I'm glad I could just watch it on television then living it for myself because let's be honest there are some pretty scary procedures in The Knick. It doesn't look very sterile at all. And having a surgery in an auditorium while a bunch of people are looking at you isn't my idea of a safe environment for a surgery. But the show itself is fabulous with great acting performances and with an excellent story. All actors and actresses were great in The Knick. I really wished there would be more then two seasons because The Knick is so much better then most of the other shows that seems to keep going on forever. Certainly one of my favorite shows of this year."

I'd like to reassure everyone who is afraid of watching another regular medical drama, this show is about medical history with it's bizarre and crazy events (which truly happened allover the course of medicine History), but in the same time it's a perfectly crafted piece of art from attention to small details to acting, writing, camera angels, sound tract and of course directing by Soderbergh.Dr. John Thackery is a character built on 1900s Dr. William Stewart Halsted who is considered the greatest physician of the whole Johns Hopkins group, also Throughout his professional life, he was addicted to cocaine and later to morphine, which were not illegal during that time. The beauty about Thackery character is that it's a true character with his addiction and the predicted mood changes (even if there is some alteration, the character frame still the same, not like the case of G. House who was clearly a fictional character).I don't want to go in details about the technical elements of the show, but one look over Steven Soderbergh's traffic, Erin Brockovich or even Ocean's eleven will be more than enough to understand that you are facing a spectacular show which has more and more to offer with each new episode (no wonder it was renewed for a second season before airing the first one).The Knick is a too much sophisticated show to be compared with other shows from the same genre and IMO it shouldn't be compared with them at all. My advice to every one: see the first season now because if you're a TV person you will end up watching it anyway."

A Cinemax original to my surprise but HBOMAX has it now and there is talk of a revival and of a third season in the works. This is a show that is so unexpectedly great I couldn't believe what I was watching when I hit play. A period piece starting in 1900 about early medicine in New York City.

I like to describe this show as a health care history lesson, on a massive dose of steroids. The peak into the medical and clinical protocols of the day are just as intriguing as the systemic administrative practices that are questionable at best.

Cut to The Knick. Yes, this was America in 1900. Corruption, racism, arrogance. No, the hero is not a nice guy and he's a cocaine addict. No, the director of the hospital is not an asshole, he's quite a nice chap, though he tends to steal money from the hospital's budget. No, the rich people are not arrogant, they are quite condescending to those poor little blackies. And the Negroes, no, they are not brave and indomitable people making the best of a racist society, they tend to be rough, stupid and weak. The nurses? White and dumb. The surgeons? Ignoramuses! The state authorities? Corrupt. THe patients? Doing quite well, considering they know that 'disease', in 1900, is synonymous to 'death sentence'. Three episodes down, zero survivors. Not bad! That's what I like in this show: they don't wash down the late 19th century cultural arrogance, they don't make racism look pretty, they don't fall into stereotyping the rich and powerful. Everybody here is a nice person, everybody has a moral fault, everybody is human. THe Knick is possibly the best show in decades. And Clive Owen rocks! Give that guy an Emmy already!"

      "content": "My great uncle was a doctor in the1920s and 30s. When I was 9 or 10, my parents and I went to my great aunts house and 'opened' the doctors office at the premises where he practiced and subsequently died in ~1950. I was utterly fascinated with the instruments, exam table and all the medicines and gear that was there. I still have photos and several pieces from that office.Having been the victim of a major accident five years later, subsequently spending months in the hospital, I again was fascinated by the differences between modern medicine and what served as medicine in the early 1900's.Watching this show, the subject comes back again; it is intriguing, fascinating, compelling... So realistic and true to the day. The make-up, effects and realism of the sets is stunning. If you were to look at operating theater photographs from the early 1900's era, you would see the realism that the show has created in these scenes. Add to that the elaborate street scenes, amazing costumes and attention to detail that the production employs and I hope that you will see the extreme talent and effort that has gone into The Knick. Take special note of some of the special effects showing medical conditions and operating trauma, it's very realistic and downright scary. It will make you thankful for modern medicine and the amazing advances of the medical establishment during the 20th century.The direction and cinematography is well done. Dialog based scenes are typically shot with the rule of thirds followed (pleasing) but there are many non-dialog scenes where the director moves away from the banal by shooting action from odd angles (carving of pig carcasses with action at mid-line filmed low) or a fight sequence filmed with a wide angle 'behind the hero' view -- this keeps the visual story interesting. Add the Contagion-like soundtrack (I know - a 1900s drama with a techno music track = ?) and the overall experience is captivating.Finally, I am not sure everyone is familiar with the 'steampunk' enthusiasm (movement?) that is finding its way into both culture (art, collecting) and mainstream style (go to a high end plumbing /appliance store and you will see what I mean!) -- this show captures the industrial late 19th century look extremely well. I am literally sad when each hour is over. This show is among the best shows I have ever watched. I would be thrilled if every episode were 2 hours long. It's that good.The acting is good; Clive Owen is not only very believable as Dr, Thackery, but really has a strong command of each and every scene he is in. Some of the characters do not stand out as well, BUT: Special kudos to Eve Hewson, she not only performs with incredible expression, style and emotion, but really looks the part! Amazing actress -- thank you!Overall, Bravo!"

It was a weird rationale to put it on Cinemax rather than HBO, but if it gets people subscribing to Cinemax, then it was a successful choice. It's another example of how the best TV shows in America are found only on the premium channels (e.g., HBO, Showtime, etc.) Although Clive Owen is the star and does a great job, just about everyone in the cast is superb. But what to me is the \"star\" of The Knick and makes it so interesting is showing what New York City was like at the turn of the century. I'm no expert, but it seems realistic and believable, and is fascinating to see, including the medical field at that time, the introduction of electricity, the super-wealthy and super-poor living side-by-side in Manhattan, and the overt racism, even though Manhattan is not even remotely the South."

Excellent photography. Slight musical interludes, subtle, enigmatic and enjoyable. The plot is truly informative and interesting, at least, to my personal taste.The series bring us at the time, dark, dirty and perfectly represented, where medicine and surgery began the first steps that would take them to today development. In this scenario around an hospital (The Knick) come to life, intertwined and developed, the characters' stories, all very distinct and credible. Stories of exciting, but also horrible, scientific medical research and experiments. Stories about love and betrayal, faith and secularism, discrimination and racism, disease, blackmail, drugs, corruption, death and murder. The series subtitle, sums up all this, very well: \"Humanity is hard to cure\". It is like a 16 hour impeccable movie with no frills and never boring. A masterpiece to me. Some scenes as realistic as they are, can be rather harsh for delicate stomachs, but this is not a defect to me, on the contrary adds value. The only negative note is that unfortunately ends, in contrast to other mediocre series that, instead, last for years.It is unique and original and I have not found any single reasonable reason not to give full marks.10/10 Very recommended."

      "title": "unique Soderbergh vision",
      "content": "It's turn-of-the-century New York at the Knickerbocker Hospital. Dr. John Thackery (Clive Owen) is the aggressive chief surgeon and a drug addict. Dr. Algernon Edwards is a black surgeon struggling against racism in this exclusive field. Herman Barrow is the manager struggling with the finance. Lucy Elkins is the supportive young nurse. Cornelia Robertson is one of the directors from a wealthy family. Dr. Bertie Chickering is a young surgeon at the hospital.This is an unique vision from Steven Soderbergh. There are some out-there surgical scenes. The characters are compelling led by the terrific Clive Owen. I also like Eve Hewson. It does falter from covering too many characters and their side stories. Nevertheless, this is unique television. Somewhere along the negotiations, Soderbergh is unable to come up with an agreement. The show definitely deserves to continue despite the specific ending to the second season finale."

      "title": "Best soundtrack ever!",
      "content": "The first episode captivated me. The contrast between the dating of the scenes and the music is oddly brilliant and gives the show a dramatic feeling all the way through.SPOILER:Doctor's Thackery brilliance is mastered by Owen who portrayed the downhill of his addiction since the first episode. How he manages to stay fully functional through all procedures and adding his ice melting sense of humor is rather addictive. The way that the writers didn't focused on emphasizing from the beginning that Thackery was a genius but instead of showing the audience step by step all the achievements the respected doctor will reveal is just magical. All of the characters are extremely well though and none of the side stories are boring or randomly placed, it all adds up to a fully addictive TV series. Love the show, I watched the first season two times in a row. Just cant stop watching it. The sound track by Cliff Martinez y more that just music. Is a journey through the time. A really mystic and futuristic touch that blends perfectly into this show. Absolutely gorgeous."

      "title": "Flawless, Deep and Historically Perfect",
      "content": "The Knick is a TV drama set in the turn of the 20th century in NYC, and focuses on the lives of the doctors, administration and staff of the Knickerbocker Hospital, notably the brilliant resident physician Dr John Thackery (Clive Owen). Having finished the second season (the whole series to date), I can honestly say this series is a must watch. Firstly, the show's attention to detail and historical accuracy deserve a chapeau, be it the costumes, the attitudes, sets, as well as the social and medical issues prevalent at the time. The show also managed, much like other excellent dramas this past decade (Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire) to weave actual historic events into the show. The show's strongest point is its' character study. Every single actress/actor on the show is flawless in their portrayal of their respective characters. Throughout the two seasons, each of these characters' personal and professional growths is detailed, as well as their inner turmoil, doubts, opinions. The brilliant thing about the show is that each character (mediocre or not) has a quality about them, so you get to love some characters and hate others. The acting and character development is THAT good. I have to add my favourite characters on the show are definitely Sister Harriet (Cara Seymour) and Tom Cleary (Chris Sullivan), whose character development from episode one really shows that one shouldn't take things at face value. This principle applies to other characters too, but I won't get into detail. That's up to you to find out !"

Before modern medicine...I just love it! From the beginning scene to the last scene you feel trapped and curious about this wicked plot. It feels like all the actors hit their marks with out hesitation. The filmography is amazing. I love the old, rustic look and feel the show brings to its audience. I can't wait to see how this show will unfold. I am a TV junkie (hate to admit). When a good show like this hooks me. I'll watch from start to finish. I'm actually going to re-watch the first episode again."

      "content": "I haven't watched Dexter, House MD, or Grey's Anatomy. So this makes my first medical TV drama.And boy, am I impressed?!Steven Soderbergh has always fascinated me with his thematic films, the last being Behind The Candelabra. And now when I learned that he will be directing Clive Owen, my hopes instantly crept up. And I was not disappointed. Telling the story of the Knickerbocker hospital of New York in the 1900s, The Knick follows the lives of Owen's character and his medical team as they struggle to find panacea for ailments. The pilot gives insights to what, how and when.It further succeeds in forming a perfect introduction to what may or may not be a breakthrough story-telling. I know it is fiction, but when it samples topics like race, medicine, authority and the period which saw the largest inventions, I can't complain. However, I am lauding the makers for giving me the pie.It has thrills, it has drama. Moreover, it has a story which it narrates rather finely. The performances are great and so is the wicked music.BOTTOM LINE: Definitely have a look at few episodes and if it hooks on to its fabulous story-telling, continue. Otherwise, we have plenty of new series to watch out for.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESGore: Infinite"

      "title": "Good, original hospital drama",
      "content": "(Updated after Season 2).Good, original hospital drama.Set in the Knickerbocker Hospital in New York from 1900 onwards, a series about the lives of several of the doctors, nurses and staff.Very original. Hospital/medical dramas are hardly a new or rare thing (though this hasn't prevented there being some brilliant ones - Scrubs springs most immediately to mind). The Knick is quite different though. Being set in 1900 you don't have the luxury of modern medicine and you often get to see now standard procedures being developed in front of your eyes. Also shows how far medicine has come in the last 115 years.Also easily the most graphic medical drama you'll ever see. You see the surgeries being done. I didn't think I was squeamish until I watched this. Does give the series a very realistic, gritty, unglamorous feel.Its not just about the medicine. The series also tackles issues such as racism and inequality, abortion and drug addiction (cocaine and heroin were legal at the time...). Has the usual relationship and romantic stuff too, though these generally weaken the series. While everything else seems to capture the spirit and feel of 1900 quite well, the writers and director quite keenly project 21st century morals and relationship conventions onto their 1900 characters - it just seems out of place.In addition, Season 2 was less compelling watching than Season 1. The novelty may have worn off for me, I fear."

      "content": "I wanted to watch this gem for years and must say: from the perspective of art department this series is well researched, dressed and designed. I was not a particual fan of the cinematography here (the choices not totally up my alley with shakey glidecams, weirdly angled \"surveillance view\" perspectives...), but apart from that a wonderful glimpse into the medical circumstances of 1900. You should be gore-resistant as these series feature an awfully lot of graphic demonstrations of operations (I am hardcore with that stuff) and I found most demonstrations well researched. the story arc is kind of slow in the first season but keeps itself interesting due to many side plots. A nice watch for all \"victorian medical industry addicts\" (me included)."

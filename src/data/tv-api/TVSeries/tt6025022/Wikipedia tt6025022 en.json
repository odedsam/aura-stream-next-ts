    "plainText": "Justice League Unlimited (JLU) is an American superhero animated television series that was produced by Warner Bros. Animation and aired on Cartoon Network. Featuring a wide array of superheroes from the DC Comics universe, and specifically based on the Justice League superhero team, it is a direct sequel to the previous Justice League animated series and picks up around two years after it. JLU debuted on July 31, 2004, on Toonami and ended on May 13, 2006.\r\nIt is the eighth and final series of the DC Animated Universe, serving as the conclusion to a shared universe which began with Batman: The Animated Series. Notably, it is the most continuity heavy show of the DC Animated Universe, and weaves together characters and plot lines from past series.\r\nJustice League Unlimited received critical acclaim, with praise towards its writing, storylines, themes, voice acting, action scenes, and exploration of the larger DC universe.\r\nOverview\r\nAccording to producer Bruce Timm, the series finale of Justice League, \"Starcrossed\", was possibly meant to be the final episode of the series; however, Cartoon Network ordered the production of season 3 and 4. The network wanted the show to be rebranded, including changing the episode format, so instead of two-part episode stories, the standard half an hour format was used. Additionally, alongside the name change, the show features a greatly expanded League, in which the characters from the original series—now referred to as \"founding members\"—are joined by many other superheroes from the DC Universe; in the first episode, well over 50 characters appear. A number of these were heroes who had made guest appearances in Justice League, but many heroes and other characters made their first animated appearances in this series. The general format of each episode is to have a small team assemble to deal with a particular situation, with a focus on both action and character interaction. This extension of the Justice League was originally planned to be explained in a planned direct-to-video feature film, but the project never materialized.\r\nProduction\r\nJustice League Unlimited features both episodic and serialized episodes, the first major overarching story arc involves the growing conflict between the League and a secret government agency known as Project Cadmus. This plot line builds upon events that occurred during the second season of Justice League (which in turn built upon events in Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, Static Shock, and The Zeta Project), and would go on to affect the plotlines of most of its episodes. It was resolved in a four-part story at the end of the second season of Justice League Unlimited.\r\nThe third and final season story arc focuses on the new Secret Society (which is based on the Legion of Doom of the Challenge of the Super Friends season of Super Friends), a loose-knit organization formed to combat the increased superhero coordination of the first season. Towards the end of the series, certain characters became off-limits to the show, particularly characters associated with Batman and those who appeared in Batman: The Animated Series (aside from Batman himself) were restricted due to the unrelated animated series The Batman and Christopher Nolan's live-action The Dark Knight Trilogy, in order to avoid continuity confusion. Aquaman and related characters were unavailable due to the development of a pilot for a live-action series featuring the character as a young man (planned to be a spin-off of Smallville). To compensate for this, the last season focused their stories on previously overlooked DC Comics characters and mythos. These included characters like Deadman, Viking Prince, Warlord, and an unnamed modern equivalent of The Seven Soldiers of Victory.\r\nThe series, along with the entire DC animated universe, was originally planned to end after the second-season finale \"Epilogue\", but a third season was greenlit by Cartoon Network. The third season started in 2005 with the episode \"I Am Legion\" (which was written before the announcement of a third season) and ended in 2006 with the episode \"Destroyer\". Stan Berkowitz, a member of the production team, left the show later for the TV series Friends and Heroes, and writer Matt Wayne was contracted to replace him. According to Matt Wayne, if the show had been renewed for a fourth season, he would have liked to write more episodes focusing on Superman and Wonder Woman.\r\nDC Comics created an ongoing monthly comic book series based on the TV series, as part of its Johnny DC line of \"all ages\" comics, which did not have the same restrictions regarding character appearances.\r\nJustice League Unlimited, like the second season of Justice League, is animated in widescreen. The show also features new theme music and intro (nominated for an Emmy). The two-part series finale was aired in the UK on February 8 and 18, 2006, and in the United States on May 6 and 13, 2006.\r\nCast\r\nAmy Acker – Huntress\r\nTomas Arana – Tharok\r\nEd Asner – Granny Goodness, Hephaestus\r\nDee Bradley Baker – Blockbuster\r\nAdam Baldwin – Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Jonah Hex, Rick Flag, Bonk\r\nJason Bateman – Hermes\r\nMorena Baccarin – Black Canary\r\nMichael Beach – Mister Terrific, Devil Ray\r\nJeff Bennett – Rick Wilson, Nazi Scientist\r\nPowers Boothe – Red Tornado, Gorilla Grodd\r\nBen Browder – Bat Lash\r\nClancy Brown – Lex Luthor, Guardians of the Universe\r\nCorey Burton – Aztek, Brainiac, Key, Sonar, Weather Wizard\r\nMaria Canals-Barrera – Shayera Hol, Justice Lord Hawkgirl, Fire\r\nNéstor Carbonell – El Diablo\r\nSeymour Cassel – Chuck Sirianni\r\nJeffrey Combs – Question, Doctor Moon\r\nKevin Conroy – Batman / Bruce Wayne, Atom Smasher, Commander Steel, Crimson Avenger, Joe Chill\r\nBud Cort – Toyman\r\nChris Cox – Captain Atom, Shining Knight, Aztek (1st Voice)\r\nMatt Czuchry – Brainiac 5\r\nOlivia d'Abo – Morgaine Le Fey\r\nDana Delany – Lois Lane\r\nAlexis Denisof – Mirror Master\r\nGrey DeLisle – Downpour, Shifter\r\nJohn DiMaggio – Dreamslayer, Lord Havok\r\nMichael Dorn – Kalibak\r\nRobin Atkin Downes – Gentleman Ghost, Sinestro (in \"Alive\")\r\nDouglas Dunning – Deimos\r\nHéctor Elizondo – Hath-Set\r\nRobert Englund – Felix Faust\r\nSusan Eisenberg – Wonder Woman, Rampage\r\nMike Erwin – Speedy\r\nDennis Farina – Wildcat\r\nOded Fehr – Doctor Fate\r\nNathan Fillion – Vigilante, Spy Smasher\r\nFarrah Forke – Big Barda\r\nRobert Forster – President of the United States\r\nRobert Foxworth – Professor Hamilton\r\nWill Friedle – Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), Batman (Terry McGinnis)\r\nDonal Gibson – Captain Boomerang\r\nIoan Gruffudd – Mister Miracle\r\nPaul Guilfoyle – Warlord\r\nKim Mai Guest – Linda Park, Silver Banshee\r\nJennifer Hale – Zatanna, Bernadeth, Giganta, Killer Frost\r\nMark Hamill – Trickster\r\nShane Haboucha - Billy Batson\r\nJason Hervey – Dove\r\nMichael Ironside – Darkseid\r\nArte Johnson – Virman Vundabar\r\nJonathan Joss – Pow Wow Smith\r\nBob Joles – Hades\r\nDaniel Dae Kim – Metron\r\nPhil LaMarr – Green Lantern (John Stewart), Justice Lord Green Lantern, Steel, S.T.R.I.P.E., Machiste, Static\r\nJuliet Landau – Zatanna (in \"The Balance\" Backward Voice), Plastique, Tala\r\nLex Lang – Atomic Skull, Blue Devil, Captain Cold, Heat Wave\r\nTed Levine – Sinestro\r\nGiselle Loren – Stargirl\r\nLori Loughlin - Tracy Simmons\r\nCarl Lumbly – Martian Manhunter, Martian Manhunter (Justice Lord)\r\nPeter MacNicol – Chronos\r\nVirginia Madsen – Roulette\r\nTim Matheson – Maxwell Lord\r\nChristopher McDonald – Jor-El\r\nMalcolm McDowell – Metallo\r\nJohn C.

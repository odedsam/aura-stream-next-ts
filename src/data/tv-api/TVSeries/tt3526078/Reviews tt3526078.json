      "content": "I must admit to really struggling to get into this show in the beginning. After Season 1, I couldn't work out why the reviews were so good, I just wasn't finding it that funny, and wasn't keen on the characters, but I knew I had to keep watching. I think the mistake I made was expecting it to be as laugh out loud as something like Modern Family for example. With Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy who have made me laugh so much with things like Best In Show and a Mighty Wind I was expecting the same thing. But then it just clicked, subtle jokes, characters that become more and more lovable each episode, and really touching moments which have made me shed a tear on more than one occasion. By season five I was feeling sad that there was only going to be one more season after this. This is so well written, and the first time I've seen Dan Levy in anything, and he is just brilliant. If you're thinking of switching off, don't, keep going!"

      "content": "I'm one of the many who, I admit, expected absolutely nothing from a show called Schitt's Creek, so never bothered to even have a look in. Well, I'm here to say I have never been more wrong about a television program!Absolutely love this, and I feel sorry for those who don't get the abundant clever-but-subtle humour that has obviously gone straight over their heads and caused them to leave bitter, whining, negative reviews. Too bad for them, but it's their loss.Schitt's Creek grew on me episode by episode, so much so that I binge-watched the first 4 seasons on Netflix over a weekend! Once in, I couldn't leave! It just gets better and better and I didn't want it to end. I am now watching series 5 and will be awaiting the sadly final series come January 2020 (I hope).I read too many negative reviews from people whining about CBC nepotism and the fact that Dan Levy got a job on this show through his father, so please take note: Dan Levy is the creator of Schitt's Creek, so it could be said he gave his father this job. Together they put this show together, and by bothering to read the credits it's clear that Dan wrote and directed (I think) many of the episodes.On top of that, he plays David brilliantly! His sweetness, fashion obsession, insecurity, need for approval and wit are so cleverly played. People complaining about Dan Levy and his facial expressions: Hello! Those are part of his brilliant performance as David. All the characters express so much with just a glance, an eyebrow twitch or the sardonic curl of a lip -- words aren't even necessary with actors this accomplished! Daniel Levy: you have brought joy to my heart with your writing and portrayal of David Rose!Alexis Rose is annoying, dreadfully so at first. But she learns, she evolves, she grows as time passes. As does David. They are very believable as brother and sister, even sometimes displaying similar mannerisms and expressions. Such clever writing, acting and directing.I have laughed out loud watching Schitt's Creek. I have felt delighted, annoyed, surprised, cringey, charmed and deeply touched. Season 4 episodes Open Mic and The Olive Branch brought tears to my eyes. \"That\" scene in Olive Branch I have rewatched about a dozen times and will watch again and again. (Avoiding spoilers here so not saying more than that.)David Rose. I just want to put my arms around him, give him a big hug, tell him he's beautiful and good and right and that everything will be okay.Love, love, love Schitt's Creek. Love the humour, the satire, the subtle jokes and the big, fat broad ones, and most of all I love the love. It's a beauty!"

After reading the great reviews and ratings I finally gave in and watched it and so glad that I did because I absolutely loved it. It's just a flat out funny show, nothing really more to say than that. While it's not one of my favorite sitcoms ever it's still really funny and definitely worth watching. It's about a family the had more money than they knew what to do with but then lost it all over night. The only thing they retained was a small hillbilly town and they had to move there and the difference between their previous world and the world they live in now is what makes this so funny. There's a reason this show won so many awards and that's because it's freaking hilarious! Give it a chance and I promise you'll like it, it just might take a few episodes."

It's full of heart, and somehow this snobby, annoying rich family grows on you more and more with each episode. By the end of Season 4 I had tears dripping down my face because of how these characters have found love through immense personal growth. My favs are David and Moira, but even though I found Alexis mostly annoying, I grew to love even her in the end.I'm so glad I had this recommended to me by friends who insisted I watch it, because I never watch these types of sitcoms otherwise.Thank you Dan Levy for coming up with this concept! I listened to him talk about the development of this show through a podcast and I have to say, I hope he writes more shows in the future."

Well, once my other half and I started watching, we couldn't stop. We've watched 4 seasons in about 3 weeks or so. This should give some idea of how good this show is. The draw was the wonderful Eugene Levy but the other cast members are absolutely perfect, especially Dan Levy and his fabulous character David. I just love the way some of the cast appear to be desperate to giggle at some points, indicating to me they are having a ball. Great writing and performances. Must also mention Catherine O'Hara and the clothes and wigs! I hope Netflix show season 5 soon. Withdrawal symptoms have set in already! ,"

This show is amazing! The writing is absolutely brilliant, the casting is perfect and I haven't found an episode yet (halfway through season 4) that I haven't laughed in. The old Riches to Rags storyline works brilliantly because at first, the Rose's are disgusted by everything. Throughout the show, they discover new selves after opening up to the town, it's people and the support of the community only seen in small town life. They all grow from their experiences on the show and they become such a lovable family.The humor in this show is sublime. It is well-timed, sarcastic, dark and hysterical. David Rose (dan Levy) is the character that steals the show for me. His facial expressions, retorts and self awareness makes for an absolute riot of a time!Listen to the reviews on this show and give it a chance...It definitely will not leave you \"Up Schitt's Creek\"!!"

      "title": "David and Patrick are a couple for the ages-they are the crown jewel of this great show",
      "content": "There is a lot to love about this show but to me it is an all time great show because of the love story between men that is the emotional core of the back half of the series. Dan Levy-as actor, writer, director-really manages to tell a lovely, funny love story between men without any drama about societal homophobia. Even the coming out episode is devoid of the common dealing with homophobia tropes that crop up in mainstream LGBT content. It is such a refreshing creative decision to ground such a love story in a world better than our own. Schitt's Creek is a grounded fantasia on this point. The writing of Patrick, David is very authentic while not getting dark; there's not even a hint of tragedy. The relationship plays like a bunch of other sit com couples over the years. Their foibles are human foibles, not gay men's foibles. (For the most part, there's just enough specific dynamics between men to be authentic) And Noah Reid is the perfect performer to play off of Dan Levy.As I said the series has a lot of other virtues. The Alexis-Ted storyline is both very funny and ends up in a different-but proper-place than you would have expected. There is a poignancy to bittersweet love story that doesn't work out but in such a way both characters end up in better places. Alexis' character growth is as well realized as David's and the conclusion of both their stories complement each other very well.Indeed, I could go through every character and storyline; the show on the whole is exceptionally well considered. It may have a fish-out-of-water set-up of any number of other sit coms but it ends up being a compelling story of a family finding their best selves. It's also a celebration of small town life-something we need more of. In a lot of ways the show's heart is quintessentially Canadian. (The show could have taken place in the States and only a few passing references to curling and form of gov't set it in Canada)And of course Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are their delightful selves. I maintain that Mitch & Mickey in A Mighty Wind (2003) are their best performances but the Roses are extremely close second. There is a reason why these two keep working together. It is wonderful to see two of their characters go through so much.Technically the show is surprisingly polished for its budget. It's amazing how much wardrobe mileage they got for Moriah not to mention Alexis and David. (Hell Moriah's wigs alone!) There show manages to keep the visuals fresh. There is a classical assured visual construction throughout the series.This is everything a sit-com should be. It is laugh out loud funny with most of the humor being deeply rooted in characterization. It shows a world like own but far better. It has dramatically compelling storylines that don't sacrifice laughs for believability and vice versa. And above all a cast and a set of characters that are impossible to not love."

I've watched this series more than once, yet still the last two episodes leaves me an emotional wreck - bawling my eyes out and laughing at the same time! It's no surprise that the last season won so many Emmys and other awards. Highly recommend! Word of warning: you will get addicted to David and Alexis's twitches and gestures....."

The peak in my opinion is the Cabaret storyline in season five. I'm a huge theatre nerd and seeing theatre really help someone gain confidence made me soooo happy. Additionally, the character Alexis has some of the best character growth I've ever seen on tv. Everyone in the show is phenomenal and there's not an episode that I don't like.

The cinematography and production design remind me of Shameless; the sharp writing and unique characters remind me of Silicon Valley. The slow and steady pace reminds me of the Christopher Guest movies that O'Hara and Levy were in. It's a rich pedigree indeed. And it doesn't disappoint. I was puzzled why so many people didn't like it initially, but I think I get it: with a title like that, some people must have been expecting something juvenile, and laugh-a-minute. Schitt's Creek is much much better than that.The confidence on the part of the filmmakers is evidenced by the lack of a laugh track, and further, the musical score is used sparingly. It can be hilariously funny, but what really hooks me is that it has a heart and a sweetness that other shows might be afraid to show. There are no characters in the show that are unlikeable. It favors character development over easy laughs, and it may take a while for people to catch on to it, but to me this is a sweet slow buzz, and I am addicted.Can't wait for more."

This is one of the best shows that I have ever stumbled upon. The characters are perfectly cast and each is relatable in their own way. I cannot say enough good things about this show. Plus, Stevie and David are officially my favorite TV duo of all time.Watch this show!!"

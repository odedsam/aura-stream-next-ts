      "question": "If David Rose owns the town that his father bought for him, what does that actually mean? If he owns the town, does that mean he owns the land and if so shouldn't they be getting rent from the businesses and people who live there?",
      "answer": "David owns the town due largely in part to Johnny buying the deed to the town as a joke for his 16th birthday. Roland never signed off on the deed to the town until after Johnny and his family arrived in the town."
    },
    {
      "question": "If Roland does not own the hotel that the Roses stay in, how can Roland give permission for the Roses can stay there rent free?",
      "answer": "Stevie Budd, who inherits the motel from her great aunt, has given the Roses permission to stay at the motel until they get back on their feet. Roland gets two free rooms because he is the Mayor."

      "question": "We know that it is a Canadian production with all Canadian actors, but where is this fictional town supposed to be? Is it supposed to be in America or Canada and have they made reference to this?",
      "answer": "Schitt's Creek is actually filmed in Goodwood, Ontario and Unionville, Ontario which is outside of Toronto. Dan and Eugene said in a panel interview that they did not want it to be associated with a country or an area, so it is not actually set in a specific country as they thought this would take away from Schitt's Creek as an independent location."

      "question": "After the Rose children get good jobs and the mother gets a movie role and David gets thousands from his old boss for arranging the sale of her business name, \"Blouse Barn\", to Australians. Why are they permitted to continue living in the motel rent free and why would they not buy a house?",
      "answer": "The main reason is that they see their condition as temporary. They're ready to move out any moment at any opportunity. Also, they still don't make that much money in order to leave the town and actually buy a house. Maybe they can afford to move within the town, but what's the point of exchanging one rundown place for another if it's temporary and they want to gtfo eventually anyway."

      "question": "When Johnny goes to the bank for a loan to buy the second motel he's refused because he has no assets, yet he owns the town.Why wouldn't that suffice?I feel like all through the series they're shown as having no revenue stream yet they seem to dine out constantly.I loved the show but there is a real inconsistency there.",

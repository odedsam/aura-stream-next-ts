The gang gets together and gabs a good gob of gossip 'bout God's great gotta-git-ya's. And fists fly ferociously with force in fear that fickle fanatics will forget 'bout whose tough rough and buff enough. It's a good show I suppose...not one to talk down about a good show when I don't have one of m' own. Ten stars cuz I can't find a flaw in the production. Watch it if you'd like."

It is not hard to understand, so don't believe the bad reviews. Also, I have seen a lot of comments stating it's full of Canadian slang, and while that may be, it is very easy for Americans to understand. The first episode is the worst in my opinion, so just get past that and you will be fine."

Fast paced dialogue by all of the characters in a small town in Canada. I have tried to persuade people to watch it by describing the characters as 'Kevin Smith's if Randall and Dante, etc... grew up in rural Canada instead of suburban New Jersey.' Some of the funniest dialogue I have heard in a long time. All of the cast are great and each character is uniquely odd in their own way. If you haven't given this sho a try yet, time to figure it out!"

I enjoyed the series but felt some of the humor was over the top and trying too hard with lots of fluff between the punch lines. Then I saw season 2. Well now, talk about upping the ante! Way more funnier, and more true to the roots of growing up in small town Canada with some real-life small-town issues!I first got introduced to Jared Keeso watching 19-2, and his role in that next to Letterkenny is yin to yang. I think he found his true calling in this series. I'm hoping the episodes increase in numbers and come out sooner than later, because watching all 6 in the 2nd season so fast with a massive cliff hanger, I can't wait to see what happens next. So pitter patter let's get at'er boys, needing season 3 asap is a Texas sized 10-4."

The mixture of brutal simplicity with some top notch tongue-in-cheek writing really sets this show apart from virtually every comedy I've seen in the last few years. The jokes are crass yet eloquent, the situations absurd yet low key. The style is simple, yet laced with subtle wit. The hybrid of dry British comedy with a loud mouthed American twist is a rare beauty to behold.A special recognition should definitely also go to the actors of the show. The entire cast seem to be deeply involved in the show and really give it their all with their characters, playing them with equal share satire and honesty. It makes the show all the better for having characters that are genuinely lovable and relatable. I sincerely hope this show gets another season and world wide acclaim because it is rare to find something so fresh and original nowadays. 10/10"

From the angst-ridden small-town goth wannabes to the obviously flaming pastor to the hockey hair goons and the stoic farm boys, everyone drinks too much, fights too much and does a whole lot of nothing in Letterkenny. It takes small-town stereotypes and skewers the hell out of them, but doesn't stick to making fun of rural Canada, as the city folk get their comeuppance too. Principle topics of plots: sledding, drinking, hockey, fighting, religion, political correctness, weed and unemployment. If Trailer Park Boys is a slice of Canada's white trash culture, Letterkenny is a clever homage, explaining why so many people in the second-largest nation on Earth can drive hundreds of miles and still go nowhere."

If this show does not garner awards for comedic writing, i will be shocked - simply the best thing i have seen in some timeI signed up to the Canadian crave TV service solely for this offering and it is well worth it - i am surprised by the lack of buzz about this show in the media to be honest. I do not know if it is because this is not based on a reserve, or an urban coffee shop, or if the humor simply goes over most critic's heads"

Not with Letterkenny, I cannot big this up enough. I have just completed my second viewing of this 6 part series and am champing at the bit for the next instalment. The acting is superb but what makes this gem stand out is the writing, it is simply non stop, machine gun patter that is intelligent, authentic and most of all hysterical. As a Brit there were bits I caught on the second viewing that I'd missed the first time round due to the Canadian colloquialisms but that only increased the longevity for me. Although all the characters are well fleshed out, the stand out performance for me comes from Tyler Johnston who plays king of the meth heads, Stewart. Not taking anything away from the others but you see his character develop so well through the very short series. I sincerely hope this series gets the recognition, acclaim and popularity it deserves. I was lucky enough to go watch the the Arctic Monkeys in a tiny venue when they first started out, I hope I can say similar when Letterkenny gets massive."

      "content": "This is show is the epitome of well orchestrated dialogue, outlandish but not garish characters, and plot that interests a wide range of people: from fist fights, to farming, to pun-battles. Toughest man in town Wayne spearheads his little band of brothers, composed of his sister, his best friend, and a big lovable lug. The town is filled with fascinating people: the meth-heads, the hicks, the christians, and the normal folk. The protagonists are at once crude, drunken, assholes who goad each other into fights, and are throwing wit and hyperbolic puns out at the speed of light. It is a combination of the brilliant acting, crystal clear dialogue, and distinct and hilarious character types that make this show more than a tangled mess of conflict. This show likely misses much of the American audience, as the action and lines move at a speed and with such sharp changes that it is a little hard to follow without devoting ones full attention. The staging is both realistic and mundane and utterly manufactured, as it is almost a parody of a realistic situation played out in an exaggerated form."

      "content": "I had never heard of Letterkenny until someone mentioned it in an Arrested Development Subreddit and said how funny it was. I'm sorry I put off watching it for so long because it is quite enjoyable. Thank goodness for subtitles because there are some things I would've missed without them. Jared Keeso as Wayne is top notch, Michelle Mylett plays his little sister, Katy and she's adorable. Daryl, Stewart, Reilly & Jonesy are funny as hell. My only complaint is Dan is kinda gross and Gail is creepy AF and a bit too much."

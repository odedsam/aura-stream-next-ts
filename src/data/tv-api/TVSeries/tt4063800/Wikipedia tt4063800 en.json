Originally aired in France from 27 April 2015, it was launched in the United States and Canada on iTunes on 1 June 2016 as part of a new international \"Episodic Cinema\" label, quickly reaching the Top Five. In the United Kingdom, the series was released exclusively by Amazon Prime on 17 June 2016.\r\nThe first season received positive reviews in both France and other countries, and won several awards. The second season has been universally acclaimed, and has even been seen by some as the best television ever produced in France. The third and fourth seasons, respectively aired in France beginning 22 May 2017 and 22 October 2018, have met with further acclaim, with praise for the show's acting, pacing, plot and realism. There is also a fifth season.\r\nSynopsis\r\nThe Bureau is based upon real accounts by former spies and inspired by contemporary events, and centres on the daily life and missions of agents within France's Directorate-General for External Security, its principal external security service. It focuses on the \"Bureau of Legends\", responsible for training and handling deep-cover agents (operating 'under legend') on long-term missions in areas with French interests, especially in North Africa and the Middle East. Living under false identities for years, these agents' missions are to identify and recruit good intelligence sources.\r\nThe series features intelligence officer Guillaume Debailly, codenamed \"Malotru\" (literally \"Lout\") who returns to Paris after six years undercover in Damascus. He has to face the challenge of reconnecting with his daughter, ex-wife, colleagues, and even his old self. But his return to 'normal life' proves difficult, especially when he discovers that Nadia, who was his love in Damascus, is now also in Paris. The first season follows his attempts to navigate the rules of life as a spy, and his increasingly tenuous position with Nadia.\r\nThe second season continues with the same themes, four months later, but also focuses on another character from the first season, Marina Loiseau. She is leaving for Tehran to work undercover as a specialist in seismology, in order to gather intelligence about Iran's nuclear weapons programme. Guillaume has been promoted to deputy director but also becomes a double agent on behalf of the CIA. He becomes increasingly desperate to resolve the situation with Nadia, which culminates in serious consequences for them both. Meanwhile, the DGSE has the challenge of a bloodthirsty French jihadist who is publicly taunting France.\r\nCast and characters\r\nSome character codenames are based on Captain Haddock's expletives.\r\nMathieu Kassovitz as Guillaume Debailly, codename \"Malotru\" (Lout). After six years undercover in Damascus, Syria, he returns to Paris but finds it difficult to re-adapt to a more normal life. When he learns that Nadia El Mansour, his lover in Damascus, is in Paris, he breaks the rules and renews their affair, returning to his false identity as Paul Lefebvre. (season 1– )\r\nSara Giraudeau as Marina Loiseau, codename \"Phénomène\" (Phenomenon) later \"Rocambole\", a young and brilliant woman who has been cast to become the next deep-cover agent pretending to be a seismologist. She is under intense training to prepare an infiltration of the Iranian nuclear industry and later the Russian cybercenter.

Le Monde commented on its \"mastery of its subject\" and \"rigorous construction of narrative arcs\" and lauded its \"different and credible tone\". Le Nouvel Observateur compared it to Mad Men and congratulated it on \"staging that exceptional routine with flair and breathing life into a convincing team of heroes\".\r\nThe second season was immensely popular. Télérama called it \"captivating, subtly written, staged and acted: a mission accomplished\" and Le Figaro stated that \"to this day, this series is the best ever made in France\".\r\nThe New York Times described the series as \"moody, cynical & stylish ... consistently smart and understated\". Broadwayworld also wrote a positive review, describing it as \"a riveting spy story told with psychological sophistication and cinematic flair\".\r\nAwards\r\nSeason 1\r\nSéries Mania Festival 2015:International Press Jury Award - Best Male Actor (Mathieu Kassovitz)\r\nInternational Press Jury Award - Best Male Actor (Mathieu Kassovitz)\r\nFrench Syndicate of Cinema Critics Award: Best Series\r\nFrench TV Critics Association Awards (A.C.S.): Best Male Actor (Mathieu Kassovitz) (2015)\r\nSeason 2\r\nCOLCOA French Film Festival:TV Series Jury Special Prize TV Series Audience Award\r\nTV Series Jury Special Prize\r\nTV Series Audience Award\r\nFrench TV Critics Association Awards (A.C.S.): Best Production (2016)\r\nFrench TV Critics Association Awards (A.C.S.): Best Female Actor (Sara Giraudeau) (2016)\r\nLe Parisien: Best French Series (2016)\r\nTélérama: Top 10 Series 2016 (N°1)\r\nGlobes de Cristal Award: Best French Series (2016)\r\nSeason 3\r\nFrench TV Critics Association Awards (A.C.S.): Best Series (2017)\r\nFrench TV Critics Association Awards (A.C.S.): Best Writing (2017)\r\nSeason 4\r\nTélérama: Top 10 Series 2018 (N°1)\r\nSeason 5\r\nTV France International: Export Fiction Award 2020\r\nGrand prix des Média: Best Fictional TV show 2020",

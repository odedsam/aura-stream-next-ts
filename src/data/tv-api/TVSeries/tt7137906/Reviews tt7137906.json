Back then and much like now, cops in my neighborhood were notorious for all types of crimes: They sold drugs, robbed drug dealers, were involved in sex crimes and even were guilty of extortion and homicides. We knew the outcome was race based, but besides the nightmare these 6 individuals endured ( Yes, there were 6 not 5)... because the police lied and the prosecutor also, an innocent woman, a pregnant woman would later be murdered by the actual killer. No \"Justice\" for Black & Brown, \"Just Us\" being incarcerated at disproportionate levels."

      "content": "Rating: 8.5/10Themes: Biography, History, Drama, Racism, Injustice, Rape, Prison, Persecution, Law, Police & Crime.Review: This story is something that honestly leaves me speechless. There are no words to describe the outrage I feel with regards to this situation or the injustice of what these five boys went through. It's insane. It's crazy. It's UNJUST. However, I'm now going to go into the actual execution of this series, rather than the story itself, which, in my opinion, left certain things to be desired. I think the first and final episode were chilling and were able to portray the story in the exact right manner. However, the middle two episodes (especially the third) could have been done better. They didn't hit as deep and they felt very rushed. I feel like we didn't really get to see the struggle Kevin, Yusef, Antron and Raymond went through after they got convicted. I feel like we glossed over their experiences a little bit. Opposingly, Korey's life was depicted in detail and with a lot of emotion (in the final episode), and it was his story that eventually brought me to tears. In conclusion, this story is a devastating one, and this series luckily brings a strong light to that, but I personally feel like some things could have been executed a little better to portray the story even better and do even more justice to all these five boys."

It's the brutally honest story of a horrible tragedy and the racial discrimination of the time, exemplified in a nationally known case. Unfortunately for conservatives, if it's a story about racial discrimination - which has existed throughout history and continues to exist today - its considered a liberal agenda, even though it is not. It's a story of Injustice, and an excellent one at that. Side note: Now some commentators have some now claimed that it blames Trump, but it doesn't. I would point out, however, that Trump backed their conviction and opposed their being let go even after it was demonstrated they were innocent."

I was very familiar with the case, even more so that I actually thought but to see it acted out and shot so tremendously was gut wrenching. Sadly injustice has been and will be part of life until the end of time, undoubtedly there's people fighting through it right now. I've seen quite a few negative reviews that this is just a puppet show to stomp on Trump and if that's your belief fine, but in my view facts speak for themselves and I knew about Trumps involvement in this case before this series, but there's no doubt the writer/director really wanted that message out there. Putting all politics, corruption and media aside, it's a truly harrowing, gut wrenching story about how five normal BOYS, lost their freedom, youth and innocence and how all of them including the victim never saw justice served correctly. A hard watch but a must watch."

A big chunk of this episode follows Korey Wise. This is where Jharrel Jerome delivers nothing short of an oscar performance that will make you tear up. How he captures the innocence, the vulnerbility and the pain of his character is absolutely amazing. Eventhough there are other good performances in the show and it is told well his performance is what makes this a show to remember and elevates it above just good."

      "content": "Firstly, I will address the TV series itself and then the story behind it. As far as actual cinema goes...A riveting spectacle. Sometimes, a bit slow and probably could have been done in 3 parts instead of 4, but nevertheless excellent! The cast is superb! Especially, Jharrel Jerome as Kevin Wise.Now to the actual story: I've been reading some negative reviews here by people screaming that it is \"Lies, propaganda\", \"how rapists get millions of dollars\". What is wrong with you people? Of course, no one truly knows if they were 100% innocent or not, but look at THE FACTS of the case.A known felon, with a history of Rape and Murder confessed to the crime. His DNA matched the DNA found on the victim. He confirmed details and characteristics of the crime that only he could have known. Next to that, you have 5 teenagers. NONE of their DNA matched the DNA found on the victim. None of them had a drop of the victim's blood on their cloths. Read that last sentences again. None of them had a history of violence against women and most probably didn't even know what the word \"rape\" means. 5 Children were brought into an interrogation room, aggressively questioned (including physical violence) for almost 2 days without sleep, without food and without the presence of their parents, who were only present during the \"confessions\" later on. So you have 5 black (PC doesn't matter at this point) children from unprivileged socio economic and educational backgrounds who are questioned by predominately white police inspectors who use a variety of intimidation and manipulation techniques (both mental and physical) to get a confession out of them. Put most children in their place and they would say they freakin' killed the president, just so that they could go home....and without ANY physical evidence connecting them to the crime scene, with greatly conflicting versions in the confessions, with confused time lines and location descriptions, these people STILL get convicted in a trial that today, would have been thrown out the window after 5 min considering how many violations were made...and you STILL have the nerve to scream they were guilty and deserved to rot in prison? You are asking to look at the facts...did YOU go through them? Let me repeat that for you. NO physical evidence was found to tie the suspects to the crime scene. NO DNA matches, NO plausible motive. On the other hand, you have an individual that has all 3 and who has no connection to the 5 teenagers whatsoever, and you STILL want to make them guilty? Un-freakin'-belivable."

This film is definitely not a 1 out of 10 like they're rating it. It deserves at least an 8 just for the acting alone to which I felt was excellent. If you haven't already, please watch the highly acclaimed award winning documentary The Central Park Five. It goes into greater detail about the corrupt NYPD Detectives who brutalized these men who were just innocent kids at the time. I was so pleased that they eventually were exonerated and succeeded in suing New York City and receiving an award for $41 million! This is still happening to Black men in America today, there are many Black men being released after having spent 25-30 years in prison for a crime they didn't commit to receive little to nothing in monetary compensation. Overall, I think this was an excellent Mini-series."

The way the young boys were treated by the law enforcement is so unspeakable. The young actors are excellent and natural. Kudos to Vera Farmiga and Felicity Huffman for playing such wicked people and especially to Vera for putting on an ugly wig. The adjustment to life after prison is quite eye opening.

I don't know how much of it is dramatised but it's absolutely brilliant. The acting is incredible.My only issue with the show is some of the artistic choices made on how it was filmed / edited. Half the show looks washed out or like someone smeared Vaseline over the screen.Other than that it's brilliant though.EDIT: when I first reviewed this, it had a 7.5 or something. Right bow it has a 9 which is in my opinion a very fair score maybe a tiny bit too high. So I removed \"deserves a higher score\" from my title"

      "content": "Firstly I would like to state, taking the tiny portion given to Trump and then shoving aside the rest of the series is YOUR right. Coming on here and trying to act like your review gives meaning, is also okay.Now an actual review after watching it all. If you can set aside politics and see the much bigger message of The Central Park Five, you'll be able to bear witness a masterpiece. DuVernay has made their story hit hard to a generation who all may not have been around or heard of the tragedy. To those who were around then will see how past mistakes are still made today. Injustice in the justice system continuing with no regards to consequence. To all this can strike a chord if you just watch for their story at the least. This will be a series talked about so might as well watch it and take whatever you get out of it. If there is any takeaway my review can hold it should be this, pause when you need to take a moment. This series is raw but a needed series."

      "content": "The reason this is good is because of the real story, not because of anything Ava brought to the table. Everything is so drawn out, as only she can do, and tedious and boring. Most people won't criticize because of the real story but I am able to disconnect the real story to a poor job in creating this film version. There are a lot of empty spots in this film. Antron's daddy's story is horribly incomplete. Part 3 was a total waste. We don't see a dramatic prison experience until part 4 with Corey; the other ones are kind of put to the side. There is an unnecessary \"love\" scene\" with little man's sister that had nothing to do with nothing. Part 1 and 2 are drawn out. The only reason it's a 6 rating is because part 4 is good. Then there's that horrible interview by Oprah, talking about when they see us now. She was asking elementary questions."

      "question": "Is there a possibility that the show will be revived by Disney+?",
      "answer": "Marvel has fully confirmed another season. It is not yet known whether it will be a soft reboot, a hard reboot, or a full-on fourth season of the same show."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Matt's motivations for being a masked \"beater up of the bad guys\" in the first place? Seriously, how can you root for the main character when there isn't one word provided about WHY he does what he does!?",
      "answer": "Matt is a firmly christian believer and such, he believes in justice for the good, and punishment for the bad; and when the legal justice fails, he believes to be responsable to do that justice by his hand. It was explained in the first episode, in the confession booth scene."
    },
    {
      "question": "Since Matt's eyes are completely impervious to light and have no external signs of potentially \"disturbing\" malformations (like e.g. Ray Charles), then why wear the dark glasses?",
      "answer": "Well, for the rest of the society (and legal matters), he is still blind. Not using the dark glasses could be confusing. Another reason: Foggy said that he should keep the \"blind guy appearance\" and use it to get simpathy (first, to pick up girls; then to use it in the courtroom).He did took off his glasses and left the cane behind in season 3, to infiltrate a prison."

      "question": "Marvel stated after the cancellation of the show that it would'nt be the end of the character in the MCU. Does this mean that Matt Murdock/Daredevil will be on one of the three remaining MCU shows?(The Runaways/ Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D./ Cloak and Dagger)",
      "answer": "They did not appear in those series, but they did appear in Marvel Studios projects such as Spider-Man: No Way Home and She-Hulk."

    {
      "question": "Where was Matt's mother during all of his ?",
      "answer": "Its never said nor confirmed in the show but in the comics, Margaret Murdock left her family to become a nun. She appear in season 3, but that relationship was never canonical to the show."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was Matt made to live within his father's highly unsuitable, violent world of boxing, mob and crimes, rather than in the safer environment of his mother or, in case she's no longer around, at least with his father's wife if not even put into the care of Social Services?",
      "answer": "Social Services wasn't involved because Matt's father didn't want to lose Matt or didn't want to get the government involved. Maybe he thought he could protect Matt from the mob, and felt even more personally responsible for him after the accident that blinded him which pushed him away from seeking help for Matt. Matt's mother, Maggie, left their family behind and became a nun, but Matt's father tells him that she died to spare him from the truth. He does, however, call her when he thinks he might die and asks her to take of Matt. After his father dies, Matt ends up at the orphanage where Maggie works and she does care for him but she never reveals that she is his mother."

    {
      "question": "what is the \"Black Sky\" in the Stick episode?The Black Sky is the weapon of the the Hand!",
      "answer": "Stick enlists Matt's help to destroy \"Black Sky,\" a weapon that the Japanese mafia, led by Fisk's associate Nobu, are bringing into New York. Matt agrees on the condition that Stick restrain himself from killing anyone, but Stick breaks his promise when it is revealed that Black Sky is a young boy being held in a shipping container with chains around his neck and limbs. Stick fails to kill Black Sky while at the docks with Matt, but later says he killed the boy further up the road. Stick does not go into detail but says that the boy was more than \"just a boy\" and that Matt would have sensed this had he not been emotional at the moment. Black Sky is not a term previously found Marvel Comics so there is no clear parallel to be found there at this time. What exactly the boy named Black Sky is and how exactly he is a weapon is not revealed as of the first season of Daredevil, and any fan theories are pure speculation. In season 2; Elektra is revealed to be the Black Sky. There has still been no confirmation on who or what the Black Sky actually is."

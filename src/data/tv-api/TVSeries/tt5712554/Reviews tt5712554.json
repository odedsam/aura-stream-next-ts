The chemistry and banter between the 3 of them is much more evident in this latest instalment too.It's worth noting that I did very much enjoy the first 2 seasons but I felt the show was still finding it's feet in terms of the format and what felt like over scripting at times.Overall I love the show. I watched Top Gear with the 3 of them religiously and I love that The Grand Tour is here to fill the void!"

Considering Amazon's budget dwarfs that of the BBC, you can imagine just how impressive their new show is.If the first episode is anything to go by, they have successfully managed to retain everything that was good about the old Top Gear in 'The Grand Tour', especially the humour and the chemistry between the three which made the old show the success it was. My biggest fear was that the new show would lose this and become too 'Americanised', but fortunately this hasn't happened.The camera work is phenomenal and the opening sequence was like something out of a movie. I also think the idea to take the show on the road is a nice touch. An incredible start - I already can't wait for next week's episode."

Well I am happy to report here that I was wrong, sorry let me write that again properly. I was WRONG! Yep it needed the capitals.Amazon threw a lot of money at GT, probably 10 times the budget that TG enjoyed and today there must be some very happy execs in that organisation. The show is at once familiar and different, Richard Hammond's boyish charm (my wife is happy), James May's nerdy appeal and Jezza's sardonic take on everything - all is as it was, but there is also an excitement to GT that TG lacked, a production value that exceeds anything that has gone before as far as a magazine show is concerned. I'm not going to go into any details, no spoilers here, but the whole show is spectacular, great cars, great music, great scenery and most importantly of all - great presenters. If you liked TG you are going to love GT!"

      "content": "If you really are open to other views: I watched Top Gear since the 2002 reboot, and the two most fun elements were the specials and the chemistry between the believable characters.But when they realized this, they gradually tried to force it, resulting in it becoming more and more over the top. And in the end it just stopped being believable. Which means it stopped being fun.In The Grand Tour, they desperately tried to re-ignite that chemistry. (Jeremy says so himself.) But by now it has completely stopped being natural and believable, and is more like someone badly copying a caricature of a nostalgic memory. And all that's left is them looking like they're trying too hard. That's just not fun anymore. And that makes me disappointed and sad.The other problem that I have is that, given their apparently much bigger budget, having each episode be a special and then some would have been possible. But they just went on doing basically the old format. Which is rather wasteful, financially.Well, at least their mini-specials each episodes give a bit of joy. I still have hope. I'm just rather disappointed."

The clear culprit here is the change of scenery for Hammond, Clarkson and May, who look refreshed and happy to be doing what they do. The fun is infectious and i feel like i'm having fun with them.I would actually say this is better, in everything, than Top Gear. \"Old\" Top Gear, not the new clone TV show that the BBC is trying to keep afloat.Would i recommend The Grand Tour? Heck yeah. Amazon prime is not free, and unless you use Amazon, you might have not much use for it, and it could be money badly spent on only one TV show.But if you do have Prime, or if one of your friends has it and you can go over and watch it there, then The Grand Tour is unmissable, one of the best TV shows worldwide.9/10 - possibly the best TV show without a story script."

I loved the first episode, and I wish I could watch the rest of the season right now. This show is funnier than most of the comedies on TV, and it has to be one of the most gorgeous shows on TV, as they really spared no expense on the production values. They even have some excellent CGI showing how each hybrid engine works.The only things missing from Top Gear are the Stig, and the celebrity interviews. While this eliminates some of the excellent Stig jokes, they've replaced him with a named racer to perform time trials on their crazy new track. For the celebrities, they had a funny series of jokes about it, but honestly there's not much to miss.So overall, I'd recommend this show to everyone, but especially fans of humor, cars, and travel. I think I might have a new favorite TV show with The Grand Tour, and I can't wait to see the rest of the season."

(With a strong tip of the cap to Fifth Gear) Clarkson, Hammond and May have amazing chemistry and still do on Grand Tour. However, most of the verbal interplay, adventurous mishaps and random fun felt planned or forced. Where on Top Gear, those mostly felt unscripted and off the cuff. That is a big difference in eliciting my genuine laughter. While the Stig is irreplaceable, the dopey American test driver was not funny and I did not believe he was extracting maximum performance of each vehicle for the lap times. Season 1 lacked the Top Gear magic but I would hardly call it bad by any means."

      "content": "I just watched an impressive, thoughtful, provocative, memorable, perfect first episode of the first season. I was not sure what to expect with the trio's new take on what they love to do the most. Actually it was imaginative and provocative enough to show that these three can come come up with the most watchable car programme on earth.The cinematography was better than anything I have seen before. Even better than the show they left behind at the 'Baa Baa See'! :) The picture quality was astounding. Whatever cameras and jigs they have used to film the show are probably the best equipment available. The overall visuals look spectacular and 'grand'. Smooth Amazon Prime streaming in proper HD gets credit for that too. Vibrant colours, smooth camera work and not the shaky vibrating car mounted cameras of yore. - Even in this department, it appears as though BBC has been beaten! Even the sound recording felt better. Now, sound recording is something BBC (Baa Baa See) used to excel in. Now, with an iPlayer that does not appear to play full HD and with a sound that feels compressed, Baa Baa See has unwittingly given these three guys an edge over their own sorry show. The audio playback was really superlative in Amazon Prime for what I was expecting for a streaming playback. Something dreary like a motoring show becomes so exciting with these three. I was completely expecting a few laugh out loud moments. What was actually there exceeded all expectations. I would expect more fun and more laugh out loud moments. I am totally spoilt. Would imagine that eventually, there will be scenes and episodes that sets new heights and standards. Is this a stunt show? Is this a motoring show? Is this a sitcom? Who knows. It is superlative fun: - That is what it is . I cannot wait to watch the rest of the season, as it looks like each episode may have its own unique flavour, because of the changing locations. Wow! Brilliant!****Just this one show alone makes my Amazon Prime membership worth it****I have watched more episodes since this review and wanted to report back. Yes, this show is definitely mega fun and it looks like it has been a game changer for Amazon. I would now expect Amazon to throw even more money at not just Grand Tour, but to other potential programming. One the whole I am extremely pleased with Amazon streaming quality. After this, BBC's old version of Top Gear is probably dead. I still like BBC drama as they are more quintessentially British compared to current content on Amazon. I also think that Amazon should try stuff like Jools Holland doing takes on Songs, as an example. I do hope Amazon makes more strong stuff like this! :) Thanks for reading."

      "title": "On par with golden age Top Gear, except for two annoyances...",
      "content": "Not long ago on a television network not far away called the BBC, Top Gear was revamped from its old informative editorial format into a weird comedy/talk show/reality/documentary. By season 2 the show settled on their starring lineup: Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond, three very British and somewhat incompetent automotive journalists who reviewed the latest models, revisited classics, discussed automotive news, and interviewed celebrities in their own unique way, Most amusing of all were their challenges, road trips, and hair-brained schemes to apply their automotive knowledge and passion to make life easier and the world a better place (often with disastrous results).Top Gear worked so well in this format because of the chemistry between the three presenters. They were genuinely organic and funny, contrasted with the cringe-inducing subsequent hosts. When Jeremy was fired in 2015, James and Richard stuck to their guns and resigned as well, knowing all three of them are what contributed to the show's success. We will never see Top Gear in this format again, but The Grand Tour is just about the best replacement we could've realistically asked for.It follows the same general format as the old show: reviews, interviews, discussions, challenges, and adventures. It's the same 3 presenters, but this time (for the first 3 seasons anyway) each episode is filmed at a different location in the world. My first annoyance with this, is that because they're following the old format so closely, and they can't use the same titles and lingo from Top Gear, the replacements are so transparent. Instead of The Stig they had The American who was soon replaced with Abby. The Stig was a huge part of Top Gear's identity. Granted he was more of a prop than a character, but his anonymity and socially removed behavior allowed for some great gags. Jeremy now says \"terrible disappointment\" and \"back to the tent\" instead of \"bombshell\" and \"back to the studio\". Conversation street is clearly just the news, but at least Richard gives a unique intro every time and the animated shorts are hilarious.My second, bigger gripe with the Grand Tour is how some parts are a lot more obviously staged than in Top Gear. TG had many staged scenes, but the show somehow managed to make all the dialogue, actions, and body language feel natural. It's hard to explain without spoiling many scenes in GT, but the dialogue feels noticeably more scripted and the events more convoluted.Many fans are sad that the show (for the time being) will not be continuing in its old format with the tent. I however look forward to season 4 since it will be entirely adventures, which were always the high point of any season of TG or GT. The Grand Tour is not really about the cars anyway. Everything Top Gear has done season 23 and on is proof of that. Jeremy, Hamster, and Captain Slow are the heart of GT, specifically their humor, unbreakable optimism, and sense of adventure. Though there are minor annoyances with the shows presentation, I love how the spirit of Top Gear was still successfully carried over."

Not only that but the jokes are not funny at all, the car scenes take on for much too long to keep me interested, even the audience was super annoying, over the top American.This shows that making a good auto show takes more than a lot of money + Jeremy Clarkson & co. The BBC had an entire crew behind it which is what most people seem to forget.This show is now just another over the top American TV show about cars, just like all the other shows that are already out there."

But, this show has been beat up, rolled through the mud and punched in the groin by Hollywood.This show is forcefully funny. The guys are scripted too much, or simply have lost their touch. Hollywood has poisoned the Top Gear spirit. Explosions and exaggerations, scripted bits that are remotely funny. You can actually see the guys are like monkeys in cages, I really wonder if they are happy with the end-result.What makes no sense, the obvious points: 1) The American is not funny at all. That dude has no added value. Better for him to drive and 'hush. His repetitive nagging is seldom funny nor does it have added value. Very predictable, very stupid.2) Conversation street is useless and not funny at all. Forced and scripted conversation that barely produces laughs, nor is the subject matter interesting.3) The tent makes no sense. Why go anywhere and everywhere if 70% to 80%of the show is about, and filmed, somewhere else? Why not cover the actual place they are? In Stuttgart the whole episode is about driving in Scotland or in 'wherever' it is about some stupid project in the Caribbean. The latter a dreadful episode which wasn't informative or funny at all.4) Celebrity Crash, or whatever. Each show the same stupid gimmick. Here he is, oh no now he's dead. Once this was funny, twice this was slightly funny but doing the same thing every week.... didn't somebody figure this would be predictable? Perhaps, free advise, it would be nicer if a celebrity actually makes it, a week later one dies.Despite the horrendous torture by simplicity, I will continue to watch as, fair is fair, the car-bits are still interesting and from time to time it is funny. The battle-ship bit was genius.Above all....PLEASE PLEASE bring back the specials!!! Travel the world, keep it simple. Nature, Cars and British humor! Cut out the Hollywood element! Please!"

It seems to be running almost entirely on the popularity of the hosts and the blind following of the fans the accrued over at Top Gear.The series appears to be trying too hard to mimic what the new producers must feel made the old Top Gear successful. There's very little in the way of originality, and yet sadly the copies, just like a fake Rolex from Thailand, aren't of the same quality. The track is half rate and may as well have been a car park with cones. The new American test driver is a cringe worthy and unnecessary addition, who will no doubt run out of one-line stereotypes. The celebrity segment so far has been a pitiful excuse to just do some slapstick humour. Most importantly though, the car segments are no longer even about the cars.The show can hardly even be considered a car show, when the majority of the time is consumed by little skits that have nothing to do with cars, and even when cars are involved, we're told virtually nothing about them.It's no longer a show for petrol heads, and rather is now more like a talk show, where the entertainment comes exclusively from the hosts and the scripted skits, rather than from the cars, the challenges, and any kind of genuine chemistry."

I felt embarrassed for the bad jokes and awkward punchlines while watching it. The chemistry between the three can't lift this show off the ground. It seems that they couldn't turn the humongous budget into a consumable show. Like the mobile studio which adds no value whatsoever. The viewer just sees the same interior all the time. And the guest car builder stood out like a sore thumb from the show's structure. And they only really had a few awkward words with him either way. The cheesiest part of the show is definitely the \"American\" they're throwing out age old clichÃ©s that don't seem even remotely funny. It's bad even as self irony. As far as the format goes it's too much like Top Gear, but it's nothing like Top Gear at the same time. In it's current state the show is not working. It seems that they're having a lot of fun while filming, but the end result is disastrous even after what seems extensive time in the editing room."

      "content": "I wont waste much time reviewing this crap... To start i loved Top Gear back in the days, i was looking forward to seeing the TGT, but it came out stupid, childish & irritating as hell!Watched 3 episodes by now, every episode hoping for it to get better, it does NOT!To Start, That American aka the stig is utterly stupid, second : the humor is even lower than that of an 11 year old kid, And ALWAYS 1 of them must do something very annoying trough the entire episode, for example the muscle car Richard used in episode 3.conversation street is stupid as well.. that 'test track' or as i call it an old potato field is stupid and its not a real test track, i don't expect an air field but rather something decent \"The star\" in every episode dies, how funny... NOT! its the most stupid idea.And many other things i can talk about but like i said, ill keep it shortAlso i don't understand the 9.6/10 rating on here.. its maybe worth a 6/10 in total.my score is 1/10 because it irritates me. I wont pay to see another season of this!(Sorry for my badly written English, I'm a dutch guy :p)"

      "content": "As a huge fan of the Clarkson, May and Hammond top gear, I was like many of us really looking forward to The Grand Tour, I'm afraid to say I am totally disappointed with this reincarnation. One of things I most enjoyed about TG was the specials the challenges and the guests, why didn't they spend the huge budget Amazon provided them with on producing these? instead we are untreated to overly long segments of what can only be described as filler television, in episode 2 they spend about 15 minutes basically just repeating the same not very funny joke in which James May gets killed trying to reach a get away car, it was like being in groundhog day, I actually felt embarrassed watching it. Terrible television."

      "title": "Still not like the old Top Gear",
      "content": "With much anticipation i was looking forward to this \"new Top Gear\". Especially when the BBC decided to completely ruin the name Top Gear with their new cast.But even before their exit of Top Gear it was going downhill in my opinion. Where the first seasons felt much more like improv of guys just having stupid fun, it became much more scripted and honestly, too predictable and quite boring.So, would the Grand Tour be the reboot to freshen things up?The Grand Tour starts off very well. It's \"grand\", it's epic. They definitely want to show off their huge budget, have a subtle middle finger to BBC and the production looks top notch.But, after 1 episode i was disappointing somewhat. Yes, the guys are back. Yes, they are still very good at what they do, but it's not like the old Top Gear's anymore. It's all too scripted again, too predictable and frankly a little boring. After 3 episodes it didn't change my opinion. Even though it's still easy entertainment with beautiful shots and now and then a good joke, it's the poor acting on a set script that is letting it down. I would have loved to see them playing things out with a scenario without a completely worked out script. That would make it much more fun, like the older Top Gear's. Missed chance in my book ... It's not bad, but it's not great either."

      "content": "As a big fan of the trio and the work they did on Top Gear I have been looking forward to this show for quite some time now. Matter of fact is Top Gear has always been my all time favorite TV show all categories, and my expectations for The Grand Tour was high.What they did so well in Top Gear however seems to have been lost along the way. The unscripted feel of Top Gear was in my opinion its greatest feet. In TGT however the script is ever so present and the banter among the trio which made Top Gear so good is gone. I can't nothing but hope they will find their way back to the things that made Top Gear so very good. With that said it is still a very entertaining show, just not as good as Top Gear was. That it has (when I'm writing this) 9,6 on IMDb in its current form is beyond me. I attribute it to the many fans of Jeremy, Hammon and May."

      "content": "Meh... Too much budget, too much destroying things for no reason, too much throwing money around, feels too much scripted, that is making everything feel a bit lame.I like most of the humour, the scenes are very nice. They go to beautiful places that make nice shots. So that makes that my score will be a good one. But I must not think about how much budget, energy, people, stuff etc is wasted for this. Is all this really worth this show? Seeing 3 old man doing weird things without a goal?"

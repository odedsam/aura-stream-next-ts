      "question": "What year(s) does the show take place?",
      "answer": "The first season takes place in 2001. This is shown when Jimmy is in court, in the opening scene. The prosecution plays a tape showing Jimmy's clients. In the bottom corner of the footage, it's time stamped as 2001. In season 3, Jimmy mentions it's 2003. So it's safe to assume each season takes place a year after the previous."

      "question": "What \"Breaking Bad\" Easter eggs are in \"Better Call Saul\"?",
      "answer": "\"Jimmy meets with the Kettlemans at a diner called Loyolas as a means of diverting them from discovering he operates out of a crummy office in the wash room of a nail salon. It's easy enough to forget this is the same diner where Mike and Jesse share an uncomfortably silent meal in Cornered, Season 4, Episode 6 of Breaking Bad. Further, Mike and Lydia meet there in \"Madrigal\" (Season 5, Episode 2), when she presents him with the infamous 11 names.\" Read more here."

      "question": "Where can I find a song I heard during the show?",
      "answer": "A Better Call Saul soundtrack, including scene descriptions, can be found on Tunefind. Also, download the \"Shazam\" app to your phone. Keep it handy and, when a song/tune comes on that you want the title/artist name, open Shazam, place your phone as close to the TV speakers as possible and Shazam will give you results in a few seconds."

      "question": "In Season 5 why did Gus go to such great lengths to get Lalo out on bail?",
      "answer": "Because he knew that Lalo would just run back to Mexico to avoid going to prison and if Lalo was South of the border Gus could then have him killed and it wouldn't be obvious that he was the one responsible."

      "question": "In season 4, why did Gus reject the first engineer?",
      "answer": "Mike brings the first engineer to the worksite, he uses laser equipment and enters the data on a laptop. When Mike asks him if the work can be done in the time frame of 7 months, the engineer says that he can certainly get it done in 7 months and possibly even in 6. The engineer then starts to brag about a tunnel he had dug under the U.S. Mexico border undetected. When Mike asks him about blasting, the engineer scoffs at this, saying modern technology doesn't require blasting. Gus then calls Mike, who then promptly dismisses the engineer.When we see Werner brought to the dig site, he uses old school, conventional methods of measurement. Such as a simple measuring tape, a note book and the naked eye. When Mike questions him about how long it will take, Warner begins to list all that will need to be done, and all the ways it can go wrong. He even mentions the certainty of encountering rock, which means blasting. Summing it up as not impossible, but extremely difficult, expensive and time consuming. At this point, Gus comes out to meet Werner and offers him the job.Many viewers have felt puzzled over why the first engineer was rejected over Werner. Comparing the two, you can see why the choice was made. The first engineer uses modern technology to do his measurements, whereas Werner relied on instinct and experience. The first engineer bragged about a previous job he did that was clearly supposed to be a secret, so he lacked discretion. The first engineer also said he wouldn't need to blast, whereas Werner knew it would be needed. The first engineer was confident he could get it done in 7 months or less, while Werner knew it would take at least 8, if everything went perfectly.Essentially, the first engineer was trying to sell himself. Knowing if he told them everything they wanted to hear, he'd get the job, regardless of how long it would actually take to finish, they'd be stuck with him. So what he was telling them was too good to be true. Whereas Werner was upfront about everything and let them know all the ways the job could go wrong."

      "question": "If electromagnetic hypersensitivity is not a real thing, what is Chuck really suffering from?",
      "answer": "Agoraphobia. Agoraphobia became a separate psychiatric diagnosis in the DSM-5. Previously, it was associated with panic disorder. Chuck's behaviour on screen matches almost every listed criteria for agoraphobia, and it is likely that he has behaved in ways that meet the other criteria off screen. The symptoms that he describes and associates with electromagnetic hypersensitivity are also symptoms of agoraphobia. It is notable that Chuck repeatedly shows no reactions to sources of electricity when he is not aware of them. This tips the scales very heavily towards Chuck suffering from a mental illness, most likely agoraphobia.Chuck is pretty clearly ashamed by the idea of mental illness and wants to hang the problem on anything physical that he can, regardless of veracity. Or what it ends up costing him."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Chuck suffer from?",
      "answer": "Chuck claims to suffer from electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) which is a claimed sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, to which negative symptoms are attributed. EHS has no scientific basis and is not a recognised medical diagnosis. It is considered psychosomatic. The show essentially implies that Chuck is mentally ill and apparently self-diagnosed himself with EHS. Instead of getting the proper mental health treatment he needs, he attempts to cope with his perceived illness."

      "question": "Why is Saul Goodman being called Jimmy McGill?",
      "answer": "Jimmy McGill is his real name. This show will lead to him changing his name. In Season 3, after being suspended from law practice, he set out on a new business venture under a new name. He discovered the name through the statement, \"s'all good, man!\"When Walt first meets Saul in Breaking Bad, Saul mentions \"My real name's McGill....\"."

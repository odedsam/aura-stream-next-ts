      "title": "What IS an \"auteur\"?",
      "content": "\"Chef's Table\", created by David Gelb (of \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" fame) might at first glance seem to be yet another show celebrating food but in retrospect its title makes it clear that its main theme is the chefs themselves. It certainly celebrates food in the way that no movie or show about an artist can't help but to celebrate their work (and does so magnificently with some of the sexiest \"food porn\" ever shot) but \"Chef's Table\" is almost entirely about the creators. What makes their creativity tick? Where do they come from? How does their personal past and present influence their work? How do they live? What does their artistic \"voice\" say about what food could and SHOULD be?From an attempt to challenge the ultra-traditional notions of cooking in Italy to trying to find an identity for a still-being-defined Australian cuisine. From the oddly modern and crucial-for-the-future appreciation of the old ways of farming and foraging (which still can't help but be influenced by current advances in technology) to the almost unavoidable requirement of having at least some traditional studies in France or under French chefs (like at least half of the 6 chefs featured so far in this series have). From the importance of rigor and effort to achieve perfection to the importance of experimentation and relaxation to achieve, well... perfection; \"Chef's Table\" shows us the many challenges, contradictions and impulses that these chefs have had to face in order to be recognized amongst the best in the world, but most importantly, to have a voice of their own.While shows like Anthony Bourdain's tell us the wonders of food by means of traveling externally and seeing the infinite possibilities found around the world, \"Chef's Table\" shows us the wonders of traveling inwards, of finding infinite possibilities in one's own memories, origins and desires. The defining elements that tie all of these chefs together is that they all needed cuisine as a way to express themselves and that they've had to carve niches of their own to be able to feel comfortable and satisfied in being themselves, in saying what they WANT to say. Much like when one first knows of the existence of \"film language\" and in doing so begins understanding and appreciating the art form far more than before, \"Chef's Table\" is a series that makes one understand \"food language\" in the best way possible: directly from 6 of its most honestly individual voices, from 6 of its own \"auteurs\"."

      "content": "I am not your typical person who loves to watch documentaries, least of all on food. However, there is something truly unique about Chef's Table. Each episode stands on its own and it is amazing to see the different processes of different chefs. The show does such a great job of showing the true personalities of chefs that the audience is able to make comparisons and differences with each passing episode.All of the chefs that are talked to have many common traits and it is so fascinating to see. All have a certain feverishness for cooking, an amazing work ethic, and have traveled abroad to expand their knowledge in hopes of becoming a food auteur.Their souls are put into each meal that they make for their customers and they view the process of cooking as a beautiful art. Each chef is currently questioning the food landscape around them in hopes of changing the views of people and the way they see food.My only complaint of the show is that it can be a little artsy, but it is amazing and I thoroughly enjoy the show. That is my only warning going in. Please watch the show, it is amazing!!!"

      "content": "Netflix continues it's quest to fill their service with quality content. And again, they succeed. This time not with a drama series or movie, but a documentary series. All based around the same main theme; the best restaurants in the world and the great minds that created them.The stories of the origins of these restaurants, and especially the chef's who created them, are moving and inspiring. The series successfully puts a human face on these places, which would otherwise be regarded as extravagant and out of reach by most. The passion and drive of the chef's, as well as the struggles they had to undergo to be where they are today, makes you feel glad for their success. Never before have I seen a documentary with such vivid cinematography. The kitchen time-lapses, the environmental shots and the close-ups of the dishes are all phenomenal. Combine this with an excellent classical score, which fits the images perfectly, and you are left with near perfection.This series is a must-see for cooking and food enthusiasts and I cannot recommend it more to anyone who is looking for an inspirational story or simply a quality documentary."

      "title": "What ANYONE truly creative has the power to teach us",
      "content": "Is a mere recipe really worth risking 'failure in life' over? Is food really something that can be meaningful and life-affirming?I love the process of creating and serving food and people who devote themselves to making the world a better place one serving at a time. And as I watched the first episode of Netflix's production called Chef's Table featuring Massimo Bottura, I have never felt so utterly moved by a chef's ideas and philosophy about life.I don't care whether Massimo Bottura's restaurant 'Osteria Francescana' has the envious rep of being the world's third best restaurant in the world as much as the man himself and what and how he thinks, because after all, history is littered with the corpses of people who never made it, despite being mindblowingly original and creative and bold and 'I'm gonna go out there and make a dent in the universe' attitude - qualities that I worship.Yes, worship.No, what takes me by the neck and inspires me to raise my own consciousness is Mr. Bottura's passion for life and being original while living it each day. What gives me goosebumps is his way of taking a failure and throwing it back on the wall and turning it into a metaphorical fresco when lesser people would have just slumped down and given up.Steven Soderbergh, while accepting his Oscar for directing 'Erin Brockovich', dedicated his prize to \"anyone who has ever created something - i don't care whether its a book or music or whatever\".I too reserve the greatest respect for anyone who has ever dared to create something that moves this world forward in ANY sense against the forces of disorder and apathy and emotional and physical entropy and brings order and energy back into our lives.I will definitely be watching more of Chef's Table's episodes, and I hope you would too and spread the word. In this mostly sad, pathetic, morose, inert, world we need all the inspiration we can get. I know I do."

      "content": "I liked the format and production values of this Netflix series. Each episode is like getting to know a new friend, who happens to be a culinary genius. The span across the planet is a good idea. It keeps it from feeling too formulaic. The cinematography is excellent and adds a travelogue quality. And, I even liked most of the subjects.Like the overpriced eating experiences in these restaurants, the series felt like a guilty pleasure. As long as I focused on the artistic aspect of the episodes, I could forget about the insanity of gourmet meals on an ecologically challenged and overpopulated planet where only 10% of the population can afford to eat like this. Niki Nakayama is my favorite chef of the bunch. Ben Shewry's restaurant was my favorite setting. Magnus Nilsson gets my award for the most personable chef.I hope Netflix has the wisdom to continue this series. Moving away from Michelin and more toward sustainable food genius would be a plus in my book."

That said, I am a food enthusiast (food blogger, home cook, food photographer) and I simply can not resist a well done food show. That said, we booted the cable and I was worried about losing my beloved food TV shows via that network. Chef's Table is far and away superior to any other food related show I have ever seen - including full length movies. I LOVED the photography, the music, the way the stories are told and the voice given to the chefs. I was hoping to discover if another season would be forthcoming by logging on here. Please tell me that it is, because this show is Simply the best. Thank you, Wendi"

I'd rewatch it all many more times.Astonishing shots that softly, tastefully and masterfully serve the purpose of cutting into the body and heart of the artist in the kitchen.In every one of them, every different (very different) chef is analized and is given the chance to speak through words and actions and the soul filling works of art and science and alchemy that we call 'dishes'.This is a show in which each piece does its part in the fashion of a ballet rehearsed till exhaustion. A documentary where the person behind the camera stretches their open hand and is then greeted with the exquisit fruit of the sweat and tears and blood and fire and brains and faith of the simple person that, day after day, peels potatoes and slices onions and then lets go of their ephimerous creations, entrusting them on the hands of waiters, resting assured that their masterpieces are off to the sea of tables and will burn in the mouths of the people and lie to rest deep within the waves of our unconscious. One may come to realize chefs are the most political artists to ever step on this little grape we call Earth."

The attention to details was outstanding. It was an A+ show. This last few seasons have turned into something else, a different kind of dish, maybe a little less about the food and about something else, even politics. I miss the way the \"old show\" felt more tightly focused, more surprising. I think it worked so much better and was far more exquisite. It used to feel especial, a rare treat. But if I have to grade it now, it would barely be a B-."

I love how passionate and creative these chefs are. It makes you really think about your food. Where it comes from, how its grown and raised. It makes you want to cook something as beautiful as these chefs. It also made me go to the web to look up some of the restaurants and chefs to find out where they're located and how expensive it would be to dine in the 3rd best restaurant in the world. We cannot wait for another season!"

      "title": "A Great Documentary Show With a Definite Vision... That's Degraded",
      "content": "This show does romanticize and aggrandize talented chefs and the food they make. That's the premise, if you don't like it, you won't enjoy the show. If you don't like science fiction, you won't enjoy Star Trek, if you hate organized crime movies, you'll never appreciate The Godfather. Same here.The show beautifies the work and one might say genius of great chefs, it has very artistic cinematography and editing, moody classical scoring, and even pretentious captioning. It's great if you're a long time fan of food TV or probably just food in general.Sadly the show really declined over the last couple seasons, as it seems the producers have gotten tired of the food. I know they got some pushback to feature more diverse chefs after the first season, which they did, but they've pushed it further with some episodes featuring a supposedly talented chef that barely touch on their food or their talent.One chef was an illegal immigrant, they did quite a biography on her time growing up in Mexico, stretched it thin as humanly possible to cover as much running time as they could, and then when they were done, that was it, her food didn't much matter. Another chef owned a successful Indian restaurant in England, they discussed how she decided she wanted to cook her whole life and how eventually she did, and then that was the end of the episode her food or talent was nowhere to be found.This was supposed to be \"Chef's Table\" about chefs and their food. If you want to make a show about the life struggles of various diverse women, then you are free to make that show, and maybe I'll watch it, but that isn't what they've chosen to do. They're supposed to make a show about chefs, but their culinary talent is beginning to be an afterthought that may barely even make it on the screen for a few seconds. How much do you respect them as a chef if you aren't willing to see them and appreciate them as a chef? Is that really respectful to them or their talents? Or did the producers select them with no consideration or belief in their abilities, but merely because they thought they'd make a good, politically appropriate story?The last season featured a chef who owns a restaurant in Georgia, who was a black woman. The makers were so fascinated by this situation, by the opportunity to talk about race and racism, that they never got to her food beyond the widest of descriptors. Her training and backstory was worth telling, but the main gist of it is she's a hard worker, she studied in France, she studied under another talented chef upon returning to New York, and then you can get on to her work now, but they didn't. They took forever going through that backstory, intercutting it with their \"social\" dialogue. They feature a food critic praising her food and creativity in two five second segments, good to know! Apparently that stuff isn't worth focusing on and discussing though. Heaven forbid a viewer interested in food and the thinking of chefs want to find out about her food and how she thinks. It's just a real disappointment so often in the last two seasons."

It takes us on a beautiful voyage. These dishes are pinnacles of gastronomic expression, nothing less than a consummate sensory blend of artistry. If you have been at such a table, you know what I mean. It is a painting and a sculpture and a literary journey and... a merging and submerging of taste, smell, texture, temperature, bliss.And there is no small amount of genius than to showcase these culinary gems but on the gritty hands of the workers that mine them. Because, you see, almost without exception (although, there are exceptions), these chefs are conceited and self-important to the point of utter ridiculousness. The contrast is magnificent.One could hope for a better lot of human beings, at least less vain, but the sprinkle of imperfection on perfection, the intimation that while we are so, so flawed, we are nonetheless capable of so much... it is inspiring.There is a real need for more shows like this one."

      "content": "This documentary series opened my eyes and world to food and cooking. Each episode was inspiring not only from the stories of the chefs but from the food they cooked. I think the cinematography, editing and music really uplifted what a documentary about food could be and set new standards in the film industry to continue. Thank you to the directors and everyone who made this series the way it is. Great work!"

      "title": "Television Art",
      "content": "I just finished the first episode of the third season and this docu-series just keeps on getting better. I grapple for words to describe just how much of an impact this is having on me. This is not a cooking show although this is about food. This is all about the artists behind the art of cooking. The motivations, pain, philosophy, culture, and events that spun the wheel of creativity of these geniuses and propelled them to greatness.The show in itself is art. It begins with a fresh outlook, a unique personality changing the landscape of the culinary arts. Then it crescendoes into the journey, the history, and finally an understanding of the beauty of their creations.For me the most beautiful aspect of the show is how it just lets the chefs talk spontaneously and how they open up and reveal themselves in their happiest and most vulnerable. There is always a lesson to be learned from every chef featured on each episode. The philosophy ranges from the out of this world to the simplest and most basic and it will leave you in awe every time the closing credits roll."

Some episodes are focused on the dishes, while some are focused on the chef's philosophy about food, and some are just about the life of the chef."

    {
      "question": "Does each Season 'resolve' at the end? Or is there a cliff-hanger such that you have to progress to the next season, presenting more of one continuous story?",
      "answer": "Each season does technically resolve at the end, wrapping up the story within it's season. They do, however, leave short cliff-hangers at the very end of each season hinting at the story to come for the next season. Entire season looks more like one long movie, cut into standard-length chapters. Overall, however, the seasons are built on top of each other, building on and enlarging the previous content."

      "question": "Why does Dustin have teeth in season 2 but not in season 3?",
      "answer": "Those were his milk (baby) teeth, which later fell out. His condition, cleidocranial dysplasia, is a real disease which the actor also lives with. His adult teeth are growing in in season 3 but they are still short and difficult to see."

      "question": "Does Eleven get any side effects from using her powers?",
      "answer": "Nose bleeds are the most common. Ear bleeds are when she focuses even more on her powers. When she overexerts her abilities, she has wound up incapacitated, with a stopped heart, and at least once became comatose."

    {
      "question": "How does the Mind Flayer come back in Season 3?",
      "answer": "When the Russians reopen the gate in Season 3, The Mind Flayer is able to connect to a piece of him that laid dormant in Brimborn Steelworks. The piece of him that remained in Hawkins go after the townsfolk by flaying (possessing) them. He then makes them eat toxic chemicals so they explode and turn into human biomass. The biomass then comes together to form of proxy version of the Mind Flayer."

    {
      "question": "If \"The Upside Down\" is the forested replica of Hawkins, where there's always floaty ash/snowflakes/pollen-stuff hanging in the air, then what's the place where Eleven goes, in her visions? (in Season1, she sees the Demagorgon there. In s2, she sees her mother/Terry Ives there) They're clearly two very different place- One has floaty-ash-stuff everywhere, the other doesn't. One's almost empty, with a floor thats mirrored, and/or covered in water, the other is like a dark, grungy version of Hawkins.",
      "answer": "If our world is one side of a sheet of paper, and \"The Upside Down\" is the other side, the place Eleven goes would be \"The In-between\", or the paper itself. Since she is in between our world and The Upside Down, she can see and hear things that happen on either side.The reason the \"in-between\" is empty and full of water is because El only sees this when she's in sensory deprivation. I.e. floating in water while all light is shut out. This allows her to focus her power to visualise things in the world."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why couldn't El find Max in the \"in-between\"?",
      "answer": "This will likely be explained in season 5. But it's possible, because Max was dead, El restarted Max's heart and brought her back to life. However, Max could be brain dead. Or Max's \"soul\" for lack of a better word, could be trapped in the upside down."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Eleven die at the end of season 1?",
      "answer": "While it's not known for sure, it can be speculated Eleven is transported to another dimension as she destroys the demogorgon. We know the Demogorgon retreats to the Upside Down when it is injured, but still don't know what happens to the Demogorgon when it dies, perhaps another dimension. Hopper is also seen placing eggo waffles in a box in the woods, which also seems to signify that he knows she's still alive, or at the very least hopes for her survival."

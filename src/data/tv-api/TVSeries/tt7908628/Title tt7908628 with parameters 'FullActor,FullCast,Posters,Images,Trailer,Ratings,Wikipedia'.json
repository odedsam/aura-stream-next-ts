The fifth season will premiere on July 13, 2023. It has been critically acclaimed (particularly for its cast and writing) and nominated for 17 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2020 and 2022.\r\nPremise\r\nSet primarily in Staten Island, New York City, New York, What We Do in the Shadows follows the lives of three traditional vampires, Nandor, Laszlo, and Nadja; Colin Robinson, an energy vampire; and Guillermo, Nandor's familiar. The series revolves around the vampires interacting with the modern world and other supernatural beings.\r\nCast and characters\r\nMain\r\nKayvan Novak as Nandor the Relentless – Once the bloodthirsty leader of the fictional kingdom of Al-Quolanudar in southern Iran and a warrior serving the Ottoman Empire. At age 760, he is the oldest vampire and the self-proclaimed leader of the group, leading him to frequently calling house meetings for frivolous discussions. Although he genuinely cares for his human familiar Guillermo, he has difficulty expressing it. Nandor is also quite naive to the ways of modern society and humans, which often results in Guillermo becoming frustrated with him. He is a massive fan of the 1992 Dream Team and collects much of their memorabilia; they also inspired him to apply for American citizenship, but he fails his test after being physically unable to say the phrase One Nation, Under God.\r\nMatt Berry as Leslie \"Laszlo\" Cravensworth – A 310-year-old British nobleman vampire who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. He is pansexual and a former porn actor, who is often preoccupied with thoughts of sex; he enjoys sexual relationships with both Nadja and Nandor. He also enjoys making topiary sculptures of vulvas in the yard, including those of his wife and mother. He confessed in season 1 to having been Jack the Ripper. In season 2, he briefly goes on the run and assumes the alias \"Jackie Daytona\", a \"regular human bartender\" in Clairton, Pennsylvania (which he chose because it sounded like Transylvania).\r\nNatasia Demetriou as Nadja of Antipaxos – A 500-year-old Greek Romani vampire who turned Laszlo into a vampire and later married him. She is frequently frustrated with her male housemates and nostalgic about her human life. She has entertained an affair with a reincarnated knight named Gregor for hundreds of years, only for him to be decapitated in every reincarnation. In season 3, she reveals that she frequently collaborated with the Rat Pack and later becomes manager of her own vampire nightclub in season 4. Demetriou also plays Nadja's human ghost, split from its corporeal form when Nadja was turned into a vampire. The ghost later inhabits a doll, and appears as a recurring character since season two.\r\nDemetriou also plays Nadja's human ghost, split from its corporeal form when Nadja was turned into a vampire. The ghost later inhabits a doll, and appears as a recurring character since season two.\r\nHarvey Guillén as Guillermo de la Cruz – Nandor's long-suffering Latino familiar. Despite his frustration with his unreasonable workload and Nandor's disregard for his mortality, he has served his master for more than a decade in the hope of being made a vampire, a dream inspired by Armand in the 1994 film Interview with the Vampire. Late in season one, Guillermo discovers that he is a descendant of the famous vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing, and he proves to be very skilled at killing vampires (including by accident), giving him conflicting feelings about his desire to become a vampire. Guillermo's skill as a vampire slayer leads to him becoming a bodyguard for Nandor, Nadja, and Laszlo in the third season. He reveals he is gay in the fourth season, coming out to his family, with Nadja having to erase their memories about Guillermo's confession about wishing to become a vampire.\r\nMark Proksch as Colin Robinson (and Baby Colin \"The Boy\" in season 4) – An energy vampire who lives in the basement. He lives by draining humans and vampires of their energy by being boring or frustrating. As a \"day walker\", he is not harmed by sunlight or entry into churches and is able to work in a cubicle office and feed on his coworkers' frustrations. Unlike the others, he shows no outward sign of vampirism except that his irises glow when he feeds on energy, and his reflection shows a pale and decrepit version of himself. The others are continually annoyed by him and often try to avoid associating with him, although they are entirely dependent on him as he is the only source of income into the house. In the third season finale, following Colin Robinson's 100th birthday, he dies and his infant offspring (also portrayed by Proksch) bursts out of his chest; Laszlo (having become friends with the original Colin Robinson) elects to raise the child as his own.\r\nRecurring\r\nKristen Schaal as The Guide (also known as the \"Floating Woman\") – An envoy of the Vampiric Council who likes to float and sometimes speak in a demonic voice. In season 4 she becomes close with Nadja and helps her convert the Vampiric Council's headquarters into a vampiric nightclub. (season 3–present; guest season 1)\r\nAnthony Atamanuik as Sean Rinaldi – The human next-door neighbor. He sometimes witnesses Laszlo doing something vampiric, but is easily hypnotized into forgetting everything. The vampires spare him because he brings their trash cans in when they forget, and Laszlo considers Sean his best friend and even makes sexual advances toward him (which Sean forgets due to hypnosis).\r\nBeanie Feldstein as Jenna – a LARPer and virgin whom Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. She was later transformed into a vampire by Nadja who witnessed her being treated poorly by her peers. During her vampire training with Nadja, she discovers she has the rare ability to turn invisible, which fits the tendency of people to ignore her. (season 1)\r\nDoug Jones as Baron Afanas – An ancient vampire from the Old Country who believes vampires should rule the world. Both Nadja and Laszlo had secret affairs with the Baron despite his lack of genitals. Later it is disclosed that he is not actually a Baron, but simply \"barren\" because he was unable to have children. In the first season, Guillermo inadvertently kills the Baron by opening a door and exposing him to sunlight. In the third season, however, it is revealed that he barely survived, albeit reduced to his head, torso and left arm. He finally has his full body restored with a more youthful appearance in the fourth season. (seasons 1, 3–4)\r\nNick Kroll as Simon the Devious – A vampire who rules over the Manhattan vampires and owns the Sassy Cat nightclub. He was a close friend to the Staten Island trio when all the vampires first arrived in America. He is obsessed with Laszlo's cursed hat made out of witch skin. (guest seasons 1–2, 4)\r\nJake McDorman as Jeff Suckler – A reincarnation of Nadja's former human lover, Gregor, a knight who has been killed by decapitation in each of his lives. Nadja eventually restores Jeff's memories of his previous lives so that he can be more like his former self, leading to him falling into insanity and being committed to a mental institution. It is later revealed to Nadja and Gregor that Laszlo had been causing each of his deaths through history, which he does again. (season 1; guest season 2)\r\nMarissa Jaret Winokur as Charmaine Rinaldi – Sean's wife. (guest seasons 2–4)\r\nAnoop Desai as Djinn – Nandor's magical genie (season 4)\r\nParisa Fakhri as Marwa – Nandor's resurrected ex-wife, now fiancée (season 4)\r\nChris Sandiford as Derek – A vampire hunter turned vampire (seasons 2–4)\r\nMyrna Cabello as Silvia – Guillermo's mother (seasons 2, 4)\r\nVeronika Slowikowska as Shanice – Jenna's college roommate who witnesses her transformation into a vampire. Shanice later joins the Mosquito Collectors of the Tri-State Area, a secret team of amateur vampire hunters. (seasons 1; guest seasons 2–3)\r\nGuests\r\nSeason 1\r\nArj Barker as Arjan – The pack leader of the Staten Island Werewolf Support Group. He entered into the truce between his kind and the vampires (which was created in 1993).\r\nDave Bautista and Alexandra Henrikson as Garrett and Vasillika the Defiler – A duo of vampires imprisoned by the Council after Garrett was framed by Laszlo for turning a baby into a vampire (which is very illegal), and Vasillika for too much defiling.\r\nVanessa Bayer as Evie Russell – Colin Robinson's co-worker. He discovers that she is an advanced form of energy vampire — an emotional vampire — who feeds off of the pity and sadness generated by her outlandish stories of suffering and misfortune. She and Colin Robinson date for a short time, feeding together on bored and pitying humans, until he begins to feel the relationship is unhealthy. Her first name is a homophone of \"E.V.\", for Emotional Vampire.\r\nMary Gillis as June – Nadja and Laszlo's familiar. She appears to be an ill old woman that communicates through grunts. She is killed when the Baron sucks all her blood when he arrives on Staten Island.\r\nJeremy O. Harris as Colby – A human familiar to Dantos the Cruel and Radinka the Brutal, two 400-year-old vampires who appear to be children while Colby portrays as their father.\r\nMarceline Hugot as Barbara Lazarro – The president of the Staten Island Council. She was going to be the vampires' way of taking over Staten Island until Laszlo left a pile of dead raccoons on her doorstep in an attempt to win her trust, resulting in her believing it was a form of terrorist threat.\r\nGloria Laino as The Baron's Familiar – The Baron's familiar, who maintains a silent, watchful eye on the vampires of Staten Island as her master awakes. Guillermo says that she pops out of nowhere and hears \"everything\".\r\nPaul Reubens as Paul – A member of the Council.\r\nTilda Swinton as a fictionalized version of herself who is the leader of the Vampiric Council.\r\nWesley Snipes as Wesley the Daywalker / Wesley Sykes – A half-vampire member of the Council who could not participate in person but only video chat through Skype. Danny despises him, claiming he is a vampire hunter, which he denies.\r\nHayden Szeto as Jonathan – A LARPer college student that Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. However, Colin Robinson beat them to it by draining his energy instead.\r\nDanny Trejo as Danny – A Hispanic tattooed member of the Council. He has an open dislike towards Wesley.\r\nTaika Waititi, Jonathan Brugh, and Jemaine Clement reprise their roles as Viago von Dorna Schmarten Scheden Heimburg, Deacon Brucke, and Vladislav the Poker from the original film. Three vampires arrived from New Zealand to participate in the Vampiric Council.\r\nBobby Wilson as Marcus – The actual Native American member of the Werewolf Pack. He is Native American, and a werewolf but, as he explains, \"Not a werewolf because\" he is Native American. \"It's not an ethnic thing.\"\r\nEvan Rachel Wood as Evan the Immortal Princess of the Undead – A member of the Council who just goes by her first name.\r\nHannan Younis as Ange – An African American werewolf and part of Arjan's group.

The pilot was written by Jemaine Clement and directed by Taika Waititi, both of whom are also executive producers alongside Scott Rudin, Paul Simms, Garrett Basch, and Eli Bush. On May 3, 2018, it was announced that FX had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes, which premiered on March 27, 2019.\r\nAccording to Clement: \"We stay pretty basic '70s/'80s vampire rules, with a little bit of '30s. They can turn into bats. They can't go in the sunlight; they don't sparkle in the sun, they die. They have to be invited in; in a lot of literature vampires have to be invited into private buildings, but this is a documentary so it's the real rules which means they have to be invited into any building.\" Clement has also stated that the part of Laszlo was written specifically for Berry. The main influences on the series are Fright Night, Martin, The Lost Boys, Nosferatu, Interview with the Vampire, Vampire's Kiss, and Bram Stoker's Dracula. The character Nadja was named after the 1994 film of the same name.\r\nThe song used in the opening credits is \"You're Dead\" by Norma Tanega (1966), which was used during the opening credits sequence in the original film.\r\nThe second season premiered on April 15, 2020. On May 22, 2020, FX renewed the series for a third season, which premiered on September 2, 2021. On August 13, 2021, FX renewed the series for a fourth season, ahead of the third season premiere. Upon the fourth season's renewal, it was reported that Rudin would no longer be an executive producer, beginning with the third season, due to allegations of abusive behavior. On June 6, 2022, FX renewed the series for a fifth and sixth season, ahead of the fourth season premiere.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography for the first season took place from October 22 to December 18, 2018, in Toronto, Ontario. Filming for the third season began on February 8, 2021, and finished on May 3, 2021.\r\nThe writer/producer Paul Simms said that series does not use CGI effects: \"There's no fully digital characters or anything like that. One of the movies we really talked about a lot when we were conceiving the show was Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula where he went back to really doing as many effects as possible in camera and figuring out ways to do that. One of my favorite supernatural moments is completely in camera. It's where Beanie Feldstein's character is walking along in the park and Nadja appears walking next to her. That was all just done completely the old fashioned way where Natasia was hiding behind a tree and the camera was tracking along and at the right moment, she walked out from behind a tree. I think there's something about that old fashioned way that makes things more interesting than when you can tell it's digital and rubbery and fake looking\".\r\nAmong the cinematographers D.J. Stipsen and Christian Sprenger's influences for the series was the work of Michael Ballhaus and production designer Thomas E. Sanders on the Coppola-directed Bram Stoker's Dracula: \"We referenced that film for the general sumptuousness of the vampires' mansion, which was our main set. Our take, however, was that the Staten Island vampires have let their place go. The former glory is evident but now exists in a worn, faded and distressed state. Production designer Kate Bunch and I had a lot of conversations about striking the right balance between sumptuousness and neglect. There are strong reds, but also yellow that has faded to the point of being a warm brown.\"\r\nRelease\r\nMarketing\r\nOn October 31, 2018, a series of teaser trailers for the series were released. On January 10, 2019, another teaser trailer was released. On February 4, 2019, the official trailer for the series was released.\r\nPremiere\r\nOn October 7, 2018, the series held a panel at the annual New York Comic Con moderated by Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall and featuring co-creators Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement, along with fellow executive producer Paul Simms. Before the panel began, the first episode of the series was screened for the audience. The world premiere for the series was screened during the 2019 South by Southwest film festival in Austin, Texas as a part of the festival's \"Episodic Premieres\" series.\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nThe first season received acclaim from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 94%, based on 71 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Delightfully absurd and ridiculously fun, What We Do in the Shadows expands on the film's vampiric lore and finds fresh perspective in its charming, off-kilter cast to create a mockumentary series worth sinking your teeth into.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nThe second season also received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season has an approval rating of 98%, based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Bat! What We Do In the Shadows loses no steam in a smashing second season that savvily expands its supernatural horizons while doubling down on the fast flying fun.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nThe third season also received universal acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the third season has an approval rating of 100%, based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the fourth season has an approval rating of 100%, based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Aside from turning this demonic household into Three Vampires and a Baby, What We Do in the Shadows doubles down on what it does best without drastically changing the formula – and remains fang-tastic all the same.\" On Metacritic, the fourth season has an average score of 84 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". However, some critics complained of the reductive treatment of Nandor's wife, Marwa, in season 4. Comic Book Resources complained of the show \"stripping a woman of her identity – physically and mentally – for laughs\" and The Mary Sue stated that \"What We Do in the Shadows missed hard with its treatment of Marwa.\"\r\nRatings\r\nSeason 1\r\nSeason 2\r\nSeason 3\r\nSeason 4\r\nAccolades",
      "html": "<p>What We Do in the Shadows is an American mockumentary comedy horror television series created by Jemaine Clement that premiered March 27, 2019, on FX. The second television series in the franchise based on the 2014 New Zealand film of the same name written by Clement and Taika Waititi, the series follows four vampire roommates in Staten Island, and stars Kayvan Novak, Matt Berry, Natasia Demetriou, Harvey Guillén, and Mark Proksch.</p><p>Four seasons of the series have aired and it was renewed for a fifth and sixth season ahead of the fourth season premiere. The fifth season will premiere on July 13, 2023. It has been critically acclaimed (particularly for its cast and writing) and nominated for 17 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2020 and 2022.</p><br/><h3>Premise</h3><p>Set primarily in Staten Island, New York City, New York, What We Do in the Shadows follows the lives of three traditional vampires, Nandor, Laszlo, and Nadja; Colin Robinson, an energy vampire; and Guillermo, Nandor's familiar. The series revolves around the vampires interacting with the modern world and other supernatural beings.</p><br/><h3>Cast and characters</h3><h4>Main</h4><ul><li>Kayvan Novak as Nandor the Relentless – Once the bloodthirsty leader of the fictional kingdom of Al-Quolanudar in southern Iran and a warrior serving the Ottoman Empire. At age 760, he is the oldest vampire and the self-proclaimed leader of the group, leading him to frequently calling house meetings for frivolous discussions. Although he genuinely cares for his human familiar Guillermo, he has difficulty expressing it. Nandor is also quite naive to the ways of modern society and humans, which often results in Guillermo becoming frustrated with him. He is a massive fan of the 1992 Dream Team and collects much of their memorabilia; they also inspired him to apply for American citizenship, but he fails his test after being physically unable to say the phrase One Nation, Under God.</li><li>Matt Berry as Leslie \"Laszlo\" Cravensworth – A 310-year-old British nobleman vampire who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. He is pansexual and a former porn actor, who is often preoccupied with thoughts of sex; he enjoys sexual relationships with both Nadja and Nandor. He also enjoys making topiary sculptures of vulvas in the yard, including those of his wife and mother. He confessed in season 1 to having been Jack the Ripper. In season 2, he briefly goes on the run and assumes the alias \"Jackie Daytona\", a \"regular human bartender\" in Clairton, Pennsylvania (which he chose because it sounded like Transylvania).</li><li>Natasia Demetriou as Nadja of Antipaxos – A 500-year-old Greek Romani vampire who turned Laszlo into a vampire and later married him. She is frequently frustrated with her male housemates and nostalgic about her human life. She has entertained an affair with a reincarnated knight named Gregor for hundreds of years, only for him to be decapitated in every reincarnation. In season 3, she reveals that she frequently collaborated with the Rat Pack and later becomes manager of her own vampire nightclub in season 4. Demetriou also plays Nadja's human ghost, split from its corporeal form when Nadja was turned into a vampire. The ghost later inhabits a doll, and appears as a recurring character since season two.</li><li>Demetriou also plays Nadja's human ghost, split from its corporeal form when Nadja was turned into a vampire. The ghost later inhabits a doll, and appears as a recurring character since season two.</li><li>Harvey Guillén as Guillermo de la Cruz – Nandor's long-suffering Latino familiar. Despite his frustration with his unreasonable workload and Nandor's disregard for his mortality, he has served his master for more than a decade in the hope of being made a vampire, a dream inspired by Armand in the 1994 film Interview with the Vampire. Late in season one, Guillermo discovers that he is a descendant of the famous vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing, and he proves to be very skilled at killing vampires (including by accident), giving him conflicting feelings about his desire to become a vampire. Guillermo's skill as a vampire slayer leads to him becoming a bodyguard for Nandor, Nadja, and Laszlo in the third season. He reveals he is gay in the fourth season, coming out to his family, with Nadja having to erase their memories about Guillermo's confession about wishing to become a vampire.</li><li>Mark Proksch as Colin Robinson (and Baby Colin \"The Boy\" in season 4) – An energy vampire who lives in the basement. He lives by draining humans and vampires of their energy by being boring or frustrating. As a \"day walker\", he is not harmed by sunlight or entry into churches and is able to work in a cubicle office and feed on his coworkers' frustrations. Unlike the others, he shows no outward sign of vampirism except that his irises glow when he feeds on energy, and his reflection shows a pale and decrepit version of himself. The others are continually annoyed by him and often try to avoid associating with him, although they are entirely dependent on him as he is the only source of income into the house. In the third season finale, following Colin Robinson's 100th birthday, he dies and his infant offspring (also portrayed by Proksch) bursts out of his chest; Laszlo (having become friends with the original Colin Robinson) elects to raise the child as his own.</li></ul><h4>Recurring</h4><ul><li>Kristen Schaal as The Guide (also known as the \"Floating Woman\") – An envoy of the Vampiric Council who likes to float and sometimes speak in a demonic voice. In season 4 she becomes close with Nadja and helps her convert the Vampiric Council's headquarters into a vampiric nightclub. (season 3–present; guest season 1)</li><li>Anthony Atamanuik as Sean Rinaldi – The human next-door neighbor. He sometimes witnesses Laszlo doing something vampiric, but is easily hypnotized into forgetting everything. The vampires spare him because he brings their trash cans in when they forget, and Laszlo considers Sean his best friend and even makes sexual advances toward him (which Sean forgets due to hypnosis).</li><li>Beanie Feldstein as Jenna – a LARPer and virgin whom Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. She was later transformed into a vampire by Nadja who witnessed her being treated poorly by her peers. During her vampire training with Nadja, she discovers she has the rare ability to turn invisible, which fits the tendency of people to ignore her. (season 1)</li><li>Doug Jones as Baron Afanas – An ancient vampire from the Old Country who believes vampires should rule the world. Both Nadja and Laszlo had secret affairs with the Baron despite his lack of genitals. Later it is disclosed that he is not actually a Baron, but simply \"barren\" because he was unable to have children. In the first season, Guillermo inadvertently kills the Baron by opening a door and exposing him to sunlight. In the third season, however, it is revealed that he barely survived, albeit reduced to his head, torso and left arm. He finally has his full body restored with a more youthful appearance in the fourth season. (seasons 1, 3–4)</li><li>Nick Kroll as Simon the Devious – A vampire who rules over the Manhattan vampires and owns the Sassy Cat nightclub. He was a close friend to the Staten Island trio when all the vampires first arrived in America. He is obsessed with Laszlo's cursed hat made out of witch skin. (guest seasons 1–2, 4)</li><li>Jake McDorman as Jeff Suckler – A reincarnation of Nadja's former human lover, Gregor, a knight who has been killed by decapitation in each of his lives. Nadja eventually restores Jeff's memories of his previous lives so that he can be more like his former self, leading to him falling into insanity and being committed to a mental institution. It is later revealed to Nadja and Gregor that Laszlo had been causing each of his deaths through history, which he does again. (season 1; guest season 2)</li><li>Marissa Jaret Winokur as Charmaine Rinaldi – Sean's wife. (guest seasons 2–4)</li><li>Anoop Desai as Djinn – Nandor's magical genie (season 4)</li><li>Parisa Fakhri as Marwa – Nandor's resurrected ex-wife, now fiancée (season 4)</li><li>Chris Sandiford as Derek – A vampire hunter turned vampire (seasons 2–4)</li><li>Myrna Cabello as Silvia – Guillermo's mother (seasons 2, 4)</li><li>Veronika Slowikowska as Shanice – Jenna's college roommate who witnesses her transformation into a vampire. Shanice later joins the Mosquito Collectors of the Tri-State Area, a secret team of amateur vampire hunters. (seasons 1; guest seasons 2–3)</li></ul><h4>Guests</h4><h4>Season 1</h4><ul><li>Arj Barker as Arjan – The pack leader of the Staten Island Werewolf Support Group. He entered into the truce between his kind and the vampires (which was created in 1993).</li><li>Dave Bautista and Alexandra Henrikson as Garrett and Vasillika the Defiler – A duo of vampires imprisoned by the Council after Garrett was framed by Laszlo for turning a baby into a vampire (which is very illegal), and Vasillika for too much defiling.</li><li>Vanessa Bayer as Evie Russell – Colin Robinson's co-worker. He discovers that she is an advanced form of energy vampire — an emotional vampire — who feeds off of the pity and sadness generated by her outlandish stories of suffering and misfortune. She and Colin Robinson date for a short time, feeding together on bored and pitying humans, until he begins to feel the relationship is unhealthy. Her first name is a homophone of \"E.V.\", for Emotional Vampire.</li><li>Mary Gillis as June – Nadja and Laszlo's familiar. She appears to be an ill old woman that communicates through grunts. She is killed when the Baron sucks all her blood when he arrives on Staten Island.</li><li>Jeremy O. Harris as Colby – A human familiar to Dantos the Cruel and Radinka the Brutal, two 400-year-old vampires who appear to be children while Colby portrays as their father.</li><li>Marceline Hugot as Barbara Lazarro – The president of the Staten Island Council.

Nandor vouches for Guillermo as he saved their lives, while Laszlo, Nadja, and Nadja's ghost (still possessing a doll) are in favor of killing him to keep themselves safe. Guillermo reveals his freedom when he leaves the basement to protect the vampires from the arrival of a messenger from the Supreme Vampiric Council, the group who oversees all of the world's other Vampiric Councils. The messenger, referred to as \"The Guide,\" promises not to harm the vampires and delivers a video message from Viago, a member of the Supreme Council, who explains that since Guillermo has now killed almost 70% of the most powerful vampires in the New York area, the Supreme Council has been forced to appoint Nandor, Nadja, Laszlo and Colin Robinson as the new Vampiric Council for the American Eastern Seaboard. The vampires decide to make Guillermo their bodyguard, and perform a group hypnosis ritual on him that will prevent him from ever harming them: Guillermo privately reveals that vampire hypnosis no longer works on him, but plays along anyway. The Guide escorts the quartet and Guillermo to the Council headquarters, where Nandor, Nadja, and Colin Robinson all begin arguing over which of them should be the \"Supreme Leader\" of the new Council.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep22\" style=\"text-align:center\">22</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"The Cloak of Duplication\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><span>Yana Gorskaya</span></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><span>Sam Johnson &amp; Chris Marcil</span></td><td style=\"text-align:center\">September 2, 2021</td><td id=\"pcXWS03002\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center\">XWS03002</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">0.448</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #6A36C3\">Nandor and Nadja reluctantly agree to be the co-leaders of the new Council, although they each plan to ultimately take the role entirely for themselves. The Guide gives the group a tour of the Council's facilities, including the \"Chamber of Curiosities,\" which houses many ancient mystical artifacts and keepsakes: it also houses the Sire, the world's first and most ancient vampire, who is kept locked up behind a sealed door. Nandor decides to use one of the magical artifacts, the Cloak of Duplication (which allows one person to take on the exact likeness of another) to win over a human woman named Meg, a receptionist at a gym where he sometimes works out, by having Laszlo use the Cloak to take on his appearance and woo Meg in his stead. Colin Robinson and Laszlo each try and fail to impress Meg using this method, although Laszlo hypnotizes her to forget those incidents afterwards; Guillermo then tries instead and seems to have more success, although Meg comes to the conclusion that Nandor and Guillermo have feelings for each other. Meanwhile, Nandor, Nadja and Colin Robinson visit a group of rebellious young vampires who have refused to obey the Council's orders, led by a vampire named Wes Blankenship. After they try and fail to negotiate peacefully with the rebellious group, Nadja kills Wes and thereby secures the others' obedience. Nandor then visits Meg at the gym and confesses his feelings for her, but she reveals that she is a lesbian and suggests that he pursue a relationship with Guillermo instead, causing him to erase her memories again and leave. Nandor and Nadja argue over her belief that he has grown soft during his time in America, and she uses the Cloak to play a prank on him.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep23\" style=\"text-align:center\">23</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">3</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Gail\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Kyle Newacheck</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Marika Sawyer</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">September 9, 2021</td><td id=\"pcXWS03003\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center\">XWS03003</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">0.311</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #6A36C3\">Nandor begins leaving the vampires' house at odd hours.

Nadja explains that Gail has always turned Nandor down every time he offers to turn her into a vampire and marry her, but Nandor decides to try again and obtains an engagement ring with the intent of proposing to her, which distresses Guillermo. However, Gail is revealed to have recently become a werewolf, which angers Nadja and Laszlo. Nandor convinces the other vampires to visit the rest of Gail's pack, which leads to a confrontation when it is revealed that Gail is also dating Anton, one of the werewolves. Guillermo proposes that the vampires and werewolves resolve their differences \"<i>Twilight</i>-style\" by playing a game of kickball, which ends badly when Nadja accidentally kills Gail by hitting her in the head with a ball. Nandor revives Gail by turning her into a vampire/werewolf hybrid and proposes to her, but she turns him down again. Meanwhile, Laszlo and Colin Robinson discover that Laszlo's old \"jalopy\" car, which had been confiscated and impounded by the previous Vampiric Council many years earlier, is stored in a secret room in the Council's library. Laszlo gets the car working again, and they move it out of the Council building by disassembling it and rebuilding it outside, although they damage several artifacts in the process.

The vampires spend their first night having fun in a casino, before returning to their hotel rooms to sleep through the day. However, Nandor, Nadja and Laszlo are horrified to discover that the hotel housekeeping staff have vacuumed up all of their ancestral soil (which they had brought with them and spread under their hotel beds), without which they will begin to lose their powers. Desperate for a solution, Nandor sends Guillermo on a mission to Europe, where he obtains bags of soil from England, Greece, and Iran, to replenish each of the vampires' supply of ancestral soil. Meanwhile, the vampires remain stuck in Atlantic City and begin to weaken as their powers slowly fade; Laszlo and Nadja try to help Sean when he relapses into his gambling addiction and loses a large amount of money, while Colin Robinson teaches Nandor about the origins of the universe after Nandor plays a casino game based on the TV series <i><span>The Big Bang Theory</span></i>, prompting Nandor to question what the title refers to, spiraling Nandor into an existential crisis when he learns his <span>religious assumptions of the universe</span> are <span>incorrect</span>. Eventually, Guillermo returns with the ancestral soil, and the vampires use it to restore their powers. The vampires and Guillermo then devise a plan to rig a boxing match so that they can win a large enough bet to earn back all of Sean's lost money (as well as a loan that Laszlo borrowed from Sean to pay for Guillermo's plane tickets), and are successful, although one of the two boxers is accidentally killed in the process. Sean thanks Laszlo for helping him, but then proceeds to gamble all of the newly-earned money away as well, before the group finally heads back home to New York.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep25\" style=\"text-align:center\">25</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"The Chamber of Judgement\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Kyle Newacheck</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">William Meny</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">September 23, 2021</td><td id=\"pcXWS03005\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center\">XWS03005</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">0.399</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #6A36C3\">Nandor and Nadja are excited to preside over their first Vampiric Council Tribunal, while Laszlo and Colin Robinson are invited to a \"boys' night\" with Sean and his friends. Nandor and Nadja cannot agree over which of them should sit on the Council leader's throne, so Guillermo convinces them to let him sit on it in disguise. Unfortunately, one of the vampires that they are charged with judging is Derek, a member of the Mosquito Club of amateur vampire hunters who was turned into a vampire during the group's first hunt and has been unknowingly breaking vampire rules of secrecy ever since, including the purchase of a hellhound (which looks like a normal dog, but can breathe fire). Nandor and Nadja sentence Derek to death, but Guillermo is plagued with guilt since he left Derek behind on the night that he was turned into a vampire, and helps him to escape from the execution chamber. Meanwhile, Sean confesses to Laszlo that he has become involved in a pyramid scheme focused on selling a special brand of pillows, and that he is being taken to small claims court by the man who sold him a large number of pillows after failing to repay him. Laszlo offers to help, and he and Colin Robinson become Sean's representatives in court: however, they are unsuccessful and Sean loses his case, prompting a despondent Laszlo to get drunk by feeding on a group of drunken businessmen. Guillermo recruits a drunken Laszlo to help him save Derek, convincing Laszlo to act as Derek's defense attorney and promising that Laszlo will help Derek to work off his sentence.

Nandor blames himself and holds a magical \"vampire press conference\" to explain the situation, but this only causes more panic due to the widely-held belief that if a vampire dies, so do all the vampires that they have created; therefore, if the Sire dies, all other vampires will die as well. Laszlo does not believe that theory, as it would mean that the Baron's death would have caused him and Nadja to die too, but he and Colin Robinson decide to confirm that by digging up the Baron's remains. Upon exhuming the body with Guillermo's help, they are surprised to discover that the Baron is actually still alive (although he has lost an arm and the lower half of his body), as he was revived by a bottle of blood that the vampires poured over his remains before burying him. However, Laszlo is alarmed by this, as it could mean that the theory is correct after all. As he is a vampire hunter, Guillermo offers to lead the hunt for the Sire. The Guide uses her network of \"Watchers” (living gargoyles) to trace the Sire to Queens, where the group are able to corner it inside a department store. Laszlo and Nandor each try to capture the Sire, but it easily overpowers them; however, the Baron then reveals that he can communicate with the Sire using an ancient vampire language.

In an attempt to lift his spirits, Nadja convinces Nandor to get out of the house by sending him on a Vampiric Council errand to collect some overdue bills from a vampire named Jan, who runs a wellness center for other vampires. To Nandor's surprise, he learns that Jan and all the other vampires at the wellness center have removed their own fangs and claim to no longer be vampires. Jan claims that she and her followers (known as \"the Formerly Fanged\") are in the process of becoming human again, and offers to help Nandor do the same: he accepts, and decides to move out of the vampires' house. Guillermo pleads for Nandor to make him a vampire if he is going to leave, but Nandor reveals that he views vampirism as a curse and cares too much about Guillermo to subject him to it. One month later, Guillermo and the vampires are adjusting to life without Nandor, while Nandor is living as a human in the wellness center. Concerned about Nandor, Guillermo visits the wellness center to check on him; unfortunately, Jan discovers his presence and orders her followers to kill him. Guillermo is able to fight his way out and escapes with Nandor, taking him back to the vampires' house and locking him up in the basement so that Guillermo and the other vampires can \"deprogram\" him and undo Jan's brainwashing. Back at the wellness center, Jan's followers begin to lose faith in her due to Guillermo's attack, so she convinces them all to expose themselves to sunlight as the \"final step\" in rejecting vampirism, but the sunlight kills them all as Jan reveals that she still has her vampire powers and prepares to start recruiting again.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep29\" style=\"text-align:center\">29</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">9</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"A Farewell\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Tig Fong</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Sam Johnson &amp; Stefani Robinson &amp; Marika Sawyer &amp; Paul Simms</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">October 21, 2021</td><td id=\"pcXWS03009\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center\">XWS03009</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">0.272</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #6A36C3\">Nandor recovers from Jan's brainwashing, but is still furious at the others and berates them for the roles they have played in causing his depression.

Nadja, Laszlo and Guillermo are horrified, while Colin Robinson is more upset because he believes Nandor is doing it to get out of attending his 100th birthday party. Nandor enters his Super Slumber shortly before the Guide arrives with a message from the Supreme Vampiric Council, informing the others that a delegation of vampires from the Old World will be arriving that night to inspect the progress that they have made. Since the delegates will be expecting to meet with both Nadja and Nandor, they are forced to awaken Nandor early, but he refuses to participate. When the delegates arrive, at Nandor's suggestion, Nadja claims that she killed him to become the sole leader of the local Council, but the delegates still insist on seeing Nandor's body for themselves. Guillermo is able to warn Nandor ahead of time, so he pretends to be dead when the delegates come in to examine him. Nandor goes back to sleep, while Laszlo annoys Nadja by insisting on making a lengthy speech for Colin Robinson's birthday. In private, Laszlo tells Nadja and Guillermo that the reason he has been so dedicated to celebrating Colin Robinson's birthday is because while he and Colin Robinson were researching energy vampires, he discovered that energy vampires have a life expectancy of exactly 100 years, meaning that Colin Robinson will die that night. Sure enough, Colin Robinson begins to feel sick and weak, so Guillermo, Laszlo and Nadja join him in the basement and wait for him to pass on. Guillermo wakes Nandor up again, wanting him to be present. Colin Robinson seemingly dies, but Nandor does not believe it, pointing out that Colin Robinson has faked his own death on numerous occasions.

Guillermo goes to Nadja for help, but she reveals that she has received an invitation from Viago to move to London and join the Supreme Vampiric Council, but she feels that while she wants to move there, she cannot go because Laszlo has vowed never to go back to England, due to his being expelled from a prestigious high-society group called the Sherwood Club. Laszlo reveals that the reason why he refuses to return to England is because he was expelled from the Sherwood Club for falling in love with Nadja, due to her perceived low social standing; however, he changes his mind upon discovering that Nadja could join the Supreme Vampiric Council, which would elevate them to the top of the social hierarchy. Guillermo is distraught and angrily confronts Nandor, resulting in a fight between them. Nandor reveals that the fight was a test, and offers to take Guillermo with him on his trip and to make him a vampire once they reach Nandor's ancestral homeland. Guillermo happily accepts and helps the vampires pack up their belongings. Nadja and Laszlo prepare to leave on a ship for England: Nadja is sealed into her coffin for the trip without incident, but Laszlo suddenly locks Guillermo in his coffin instead of entering it himself. Nandor waits at the train station for Guillermo, but is forced to depart alone when he does not show up, while Guillermo and Nadja are loaded onto the ship bound for London.

Baby Colin is rapidly growing and has now started his own Lego-based YouTube channel, while Guillermo and Laszlo bicker over his love of musical theatre until Laszlo accepts that he cannot change Baby Colin's interests. Meanwhile, Nandor worries that he may not be good enough for Marwa, so he decides to use one of his remaining wishes to obtain the world's largest penis. Guillermo helps him to work out the best possible phrasing of the wish, but due to Nandor's thanking Guillermo for his help while making the wish, the Djinn tricks them by adding an extra element to the wish that forces Nandor to think about Guillermo every time he engages in sex. At the nightclub opening, Nadja convinces Richie to kill Tom and return to his own style of performance, but this backfires when Richie reveals that he has recently developed a passion for stand-up comedy instead of singing. The attending crowd of vampires almost become violent, but Baby Colin defuses the situation by singing in Richie's place.

To try and solve the problem, she organizes a trip to the Night Market, a secret marketplace used by many types of supernatural creatures. While Nadja searches for a product that can help her deal with the wraiths, Laszlo takes the opportunity to educate Baby Colin on the ways of different supernatural cultures, and Nandor accidentally volunteers Guillermo to take part in a series of fights against other vampires' familiars. Guillermo wins all of the fights easily, but irritates the crowd by refusing to harm any of the other familiars. His last opponent is a powerful vampire, but Nandor steps in and volunteers to fight Guillermo himself instead, thereby protecting Guillermo from either dying or publicly killing a vampire. After a lengthy fight, Guillermo devises a plan for them to escape, and Nandor pretends to snap his neck so the match can end without either of them dying. Nadja succeeds in purchasing a substance known as \"water lily of the Nile,\" a powerful narcotic for wraiths, and uses it as leverage to bribe the wraiths' union leader, Xerxes; however, the other wraiths then kill him, so she reluctantly agrees to improve their working conditions.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep35\" style=\"text-align:center\">35</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Private School\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Kyle Newacheck</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><span>Ayo Edebiri</span> &amp; Shana Gohd</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">August 2, 2022</td><td id=\"pcXWS04005\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center\">XWS04005</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">0.391</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #A60F74\">Baby Colin is still growing quickly, and has begun wreaking havoc around the house.

The vampires' neighbor Sean recommends the private school that he went to, and arranges for them to have a meeting with the school's headmaster. After a lengthy interview process, in which the vampires repeatedly use their hypnosis to imitate a wide variety of family dynamics in the hopes of convincing the headmaster to accept Baby Colin into the school, they are ultimately successful. Guillermo is able to obtain a fake transcript for Baby Colin, but it's also revealed that he has been embezzling some of the nightclub's profits to help his family. The headmaster dies of a stroke due to having been hypnotized too many times, so Baby Colin is not accepted into the private school; instead, the vampires enroll him in a number of different local children's sports teams, as another way of giving him the social enrichment that he needs. Meanwhile, Nandor has been using some of the Djinn's wishes to try and improve his physical appearance so he can be more worthy of Marwa, but he ultimately decides that these alterations are pointless and uses another wish to revert his appearance back to normal.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep36\" style=\"text-align:center\">36</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">6</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"The Wedding\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Tig Fong</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Sam Johnson &amp; Sarah Naftalis &amp; Marika Sawyer &amp; Paul Simms</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">August 9, 2022</td><td id=\"pcXWS04009\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center\">XWS04009</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">0.372</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #A60F74\">Nandor and Marwa's wedding is approaching, but Nandor is nervous and convinced that somebody is trying to sabotage the wedding.

Guillermo encounters his vampire friend Derek, who is now working at a convenience store, and invites him to the wedding. At the wedding, when the Baron starts his marriage liturgy, many people state reasons why they don't think Nandor and Marwa should get married. After an hour of this, Marwa admits that she had her own doubts and was thinking of cancelling the wedding, but decided to go through with it because she \"likes what Nandor likes.\" At the wedding reception, Nandor receives a miniature lamp from the Djinn as a gift, which only has three wishes.

Running out of options, Nadja attempts to burn down the nightclub, but the club's blood sprinklers mean that only her office is burned, destroying the money that she had been hiding there, while it's also revealed that the club has no insurance. Colin continues smashing holes in the walls of his old room, until he finds a series of clues that lead him to a secret room hidden behind one of the walls, which is full of old diaries and clothes that were left behind by the original Colin. Colin reads all of the diaries, which causes him to regain the appearance and memories of the original Colin Robinson. Since the original Colin Robinson was in charge of the vampires' bank accounts, this means that they can finally get the money they need to repair the house; however, Colin has forgotten the year that he lived as \"Baby Colin,\" saddening Laszlo.

The pilot was written by Jemaine Clement and directed by Taika Waititi, both of whom are also executive producers alongside Scott Rudin, Paul Simms, Garrett Basch, and Eli Bush. On May 3, 2018, it was announced that FX had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes, which premiered on March 27, 2019.</p><p>According to Clement: \"We stay pretty basic '70s/'80s vampire rules, with a little bit of '30s. They can turn into bats. They can't go in the sunlight; they don't sparkle in the sun, they die. They have to be invited in; in a lot of literature vampires have to be invited into private buildings, but this is a documentary so it's the real rules which means they have to be invited into any building.\" Clement has also stated that the part of Laszlo was written specifically for Berry. The main influences on the series are Fright Night, Martin, The Lost Boys, Nosferatu, Interview with the Vampire, Vampire's Kiss, and Bram Stoker's Dracula. The character Nadja was named after the 1994 film of the same name.</p><p>The song used in the opening credits is \"You're Dead\" by Norma Tanega (1966), which was used during the opening credits sequence in the original film.</p><p>The second season premiered on April 15, 2020. On May 22, 2020, FX renewed the series for a third season, which premiered on September 2, 2021. On August 13, 2021, FX renewed the series for a fourth season, ahead of the third season premiere. Upon the fourth season's renewal, it was reported that Rudin would no longer be an executive producer, beginning with the third season, due to allegations of abusive behavior. On June 6, 2022, FX renewed the series for a fifth and sixth season, ahead of the fourth season premiere.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Principal photography for the first season took place from October 22 to December 18, 2018, in Toronto, Ontario. Filming for the third season began on February 8, 2021, and finished on May 3, 2021.</p><p>The writer/producer Paul Simms said that series does not use CGI effects: \"There's no fully digital characters or anything like that. One of the movies we really talked about a lot when we were conceiving the show was Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula where he went back to really doing as many effects as possible in camera and figuring out ways to do that. One of my favorite supernatural moments is completely in camera. It's where Beanie Feldstein's character is walking along in the park and Nadja appears walking next to her. That was all just done completely the old fashioned way where Natasia was hiding behind a tree and the camera was tracking along and at the right moment, she walked out from behind a tree. I think there's something about that old fashioned way that makes things more interesting than when you can tell it's digital and rubbery and fake looking\".</p><p>Among the cinematographers D.J. Stipsen and Christian Sprenger's influences for the series was the work of Michael Ballhaus and production designer Thomas E. Sanders on the Coppola-directed Bram Stoker's Dracula: \"We referenced that film for the general sumptuousness of the vampires' mansion, which was our main set. Our take, however, was that the Staten Island vampires have let their place go. The former glory is evident but now exists in a worn, faded and distressed state. Production designer Kate Bunch and I had a lot of conversations about striking the right balance between sumptuousness and neglect. There are strong reds, but also yellow that has faded to the point of being a warm brown.\"</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Marketing</h4><p>On October 31, 2018, a series of teaser trailers for the series were released. On January 10, 2019, another teaser trailer was released. On February 4, 2019, the official trailer for the series was released.</p><h4>Premiere</h4><p>On October 7, 2018, the series held a panel at the annual New York Comic Con moderated by Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall and featuring co-creators Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement, along with fellow executive producer Paul Simms. Before the panel began, the first episode of the series was screened for the audience. The world premiere for the series was screened during the 2019 South by Southwest film festival in Austin, Texas as a part of the festival's \"Episodic Premieres\" series.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Critical response</h4><p>The first season received acclaim from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 94%, based on 71 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Delightfully absurd and ridiculously fun, What We Do in the Shadows expands on the film's vampiric lore and finds fresh perspective in its charming, off-kilter cast to create a mockumentary series worth sinking your teeth into.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".</p><p>The second season also received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season has an approval rating of 98%, based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Bat! What We Do In the Shadows loses no steam in a smashing second season that savvily expands its supernatural horizons while doubling down on the fast flying fun.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".</p><p>The third season also received universal acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the third season has an approval rating of 100%, based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Carried on the wings of its cast's incredible chemistry and the strongest writing of the series so far, What We Do in the Shadows' third season is scary good.\" On Metacritic, the third season has an average score of 96 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".</p><p>The fourth season also received universal acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the fourth season has an approval rating of 100%, based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Aside from turning this demonic household into Three Vampires and a Baby, What We Do in the Shadows doubles down on what it does best without drastically changing the formula – and remains fang-tastic all the same.\" On Metacritic, the fourth season has an average score of 84 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". However, some critics complained of the reductive treatment of Nandor's wife, Marwa, in season 4. Comic Book Resources complained of the show \"stripping a woman of her identity – physically and mentally – for laughs\" and The Mary Sue stated that \"What We Do in the Shadows missed hard with its treatment of Marwa.\"</p><h4>Ratings</h4><h4>Season 1</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><caption><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\"

      "answer": "While it's not recommended to watch if you haven't, if you like Lynch for the sake of Lynch, you may find enough here to enjoy.The prequel movie, Fire Walk With Me, is more important to understanding The Return. I would recommend watching the original series first, skipping over some of the more unnecessary episodes in season 2, if you don't want to watch all the way through."

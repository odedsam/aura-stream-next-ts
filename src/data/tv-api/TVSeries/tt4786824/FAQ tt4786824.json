      "question": "Is there a reason, other then age of the queen, that they've switched the actress playing Queen Elizabeth II? I really loved Claire Foy.",
      "answer": "The creator and writer Peter Morgan mentions in The Crown's official podcast they could also have gone the route of digitally aging Claire Foy and some of the key actors, if they wanted. But from very early on, particularly for the Queen's role, Peter and the Team thought it would not make sense to ask Claire Foy (who is 35 years old) to portray an experienced woman, with grown children and who even at the start of series 3 is over 40 (and considerably older as the series advances). He mentions that she would naturally lack the real life experience to draw from when it came to portray an older woman. They also mention that Olivia Colman was effectively the first and only choice they had to play the Queen for series 3 and 4. \"A full list of 1\" as they put it. Thankfully for us, she said yes straightaway.At the time of the switch Queen Elizabeth would be 39 as evidenced by her birth year (1926) and 1965 being when she'd be 39. I believe Season 3 starts pre-1965 and I would have rather had Claire Foy continue until the episode in Season 3 turned to year 1968. Olivia Colman skews much older looking and really looked way older than 39 at the beginning.The creator and writer Peter Morgan and his \"Team\" are all blind, obviously; Olivia Colman has BROWN EYES unlike The Queen and Claire Foy. Your eyes color does not change from blue to brown when you turn 40 years."

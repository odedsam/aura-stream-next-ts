We can now show live on our planet in entirely new ways; bring you closer to animals than ever before and reveal new wildlife dramas for the very first time. But that is not all; the planet has changed too. Never have our wildernesses been as fragile and as precious as they are today. At this crucial time for the natural world we will journey to every corner of the globe; to explore the greatest treasures of our living planet, and reveal the extreme lengths animals go to to survive.\"— David Attenborough's opening words\r\n\"Now, over half of us live in an urban environment. My home, too, is here, in the city of London. Looking down on this great metropolis, the ingenuity with which we continue to reshape the surface of our planet is very striking. But it's also sobering. It reminds me of just how easy it is for us to lose our connection with the natural world. Yet, it's on this connection that the future of both humanity and the natural world will depend. And surely, it is our responsibility to do everything within our power to create a planet that provides a home not just for us, but for all life on Earth.\"— David Attenborough, in closing\r\nReception\r\nCritical reception\r\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of 28 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Planet Earth II offers a spectacular, moving, unprecedented account of the natural world.\"\r\nThe Independent's Christopher Hooton said of the series: \"It is undoubtedly the greatest TV nature documentary to date and there's a strong case for it being one of the best TV series full stop.\" Michael Hogan from The Telegraph compared this series to the original Planet Earth series and said that \"advances in technology have enabled intimate high-definition close-ups and gasp-inducing aerial shots\" and said \"It has become predictable to heap superlatives upon the BBC Natural History Unit and wax lyrical about Attenborough's status. But both institutions should be treasured while we're lucky enough to still have them.\" Gerard O'Donovan gave the series 5 out of 5 stars in The Telegraph, calling it \"one of the most stunningly vivid and engaging natural history films I've ever seen\".\r\nIn The New York Times, Neil Glenzinger said \"nature photography has rarely been as spectacular as it is in Planet Earth II.\" The Hollywood Reporter's Tim Goodman called the series a \"truly sublime accomplishment, an epic achievement that everyone should watch.\"\r\nSeveral outlets particularly highlighted the racer snake and marine iguana sequence from \"Islands\" as a memorable highlight of the series.\r\nHowever, The Guardian's Martin Hughes-Games, while calling the series \"spectacular and fascinating\", accused programmes such as this of breeding complacency about the destruction of wildlife by painting a misleading picture of the planet. He wrote that series such as Planet Earth had \"become a disaster for the world's wildlife\" and that while world animal populations are decreasing, \"the producers continue to go to the fast shrinking parks and reserves to make their films – creating a beautiful, beguiling fantasy world\".\r\nAs of 2023, the series is the highest rated television series of all time on IMDb's list of Top Rated TV Shows. The Guardian listed the series as the best television show of 2016 and in 2019 ranked it along with the first Planet Earth series 72nd on a list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century.\r\nAwards and nominations\r\nMerchandise\r\nDVD and Blu-ray\r\nIn the UK, the series was released as a two-disc DVD or Blu-ray set on 5 December 2016, while a four-disc 4K UHD Blu-ray + Blu-ray set was released later on 13 March 2017. These releases were distributed by BBC Worldwide.\r\nIn the US and Canada, the DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K UHD Blu-ray sets were released on 28 March 2017 and distributed by BBC Worldwide Americas.

Somewhere on the island of <span>Escudo</span> off the coast of <span>Panama</span>, a male <span>pygmy three-toed sloth</span> heard the distant mating call as he swims across the shallow mangrove seas in search of a lone female. On the <span>Komodo</span> island of <span>Indonesia</span>, male <span>Komodo dragons</span> compete with each other to earn the sole mating right.

The ibexes climb down the slope to drink while the kids learn to evade <span>Arabian red foxes</span>. A female <span>golden eagle</span> glides 100 miles across the <span>Alps</span> slopes in a single day to find food in winter before spotting fox carrion, infested with scavenging crows, that can sustain her days. However, the carrion attracts other eagles forcing her to continue her search. Meanwhile, thousands of <span>avalanches</span> from the <span>Rocky Mountains</span> occur every year resulting in catastrophic effects of debris; <span>grizzly bears</span> make their dens for hibernation at 10,000 feet in the deep snow of leeward slope. In spring, a mother bear and her cubs descend into the valley in search of food and to evade avalanche debris. As <span>marmots</span> make warning calls, the bears scratch themselves on trees, marking their scents before they continue their foraging. Winter in the <span>Rockies</span> will reach at least -54° Celsius after the creation of diamond dust. A <span>bobcat</span> leaves its territory to hunt and finds a suitable valley where the river doesn't freeze and volcanic hot springs where other animals have arrived to feed.

As the sun rises on the <span>Andes</span> of <span>Bolivia</span>, <span>southern viscachas</span> settle at the sun's ray to get warm while the largest colonies of <span>Andean flamingos</span> are trapped in the icy alkali lake at night as they struggle to break free. But as the sun gets hotter, the viscachas retreat towards the shade, and the flamingoes who are immune to the sun's heat start parading across the lake for breeding. Human activities and climate changes start to affect the mountainous ecosystem, resulting in infrastructure buildings in the Alps, shortening hibernation seasons in the Rockies, and melting glaciers in the Andes, including snow decline in the Himalayas. Somewhere in the Himalayas, the mother snow leopard fends off against two male leopards while protecting her adolescent cub, resulting in her injuries. After months of recovery, the mother ventures off across the Himalayan slopes on her own while departing her cub, who is now old enough to fend for herself. The narrator states that they will soon be reunited before facing their time alone.</p>The <i>Planet Earth II Diaries</i> reveals the team's exploration of the Alps while filming golden eagles. The teams use paragliders to follow the eagle's flight pattern while wearing a helmet camera to focus on the eagle's perspective.

A young <span>Draco lizard</span> searches for ants on a tree but larger male challenges him, to which the young male chooses to glide to safety. 300 years ago, a giant <span>hura tree</span> began to grow taller as it races to absorb water and sunlight for survival, which it carries 1000 other plants within its branches. Hundreds of <span>hummingbird</span> species in <span>Ecuador</span> compete with each other to feed nectar. <span>Sword-billed hummingbirds</span> avoid competition with other hummingbirds by using their long beaks to reach the nectar in the deepest flowers which are inaccessible to the other hummingbirds. The rainforest trees provide transpiration as the moisture vaporized causing rainfall, and supporting all life. Deep in the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Amazon Rainforest</span> of <span>Brazil</span>, the trees are suddenly submerged from flooding caused by seasonal rainfall while <span>Araguaian river dolphins</span>, a newly discovered species, use their sonars to hunt in the murky waters. Even though the rainfall cause mass flooding, the jungle provides abundant food within a shallow margin for large animals that thrive through lush vegetation like the mighty <span>jaguar</span>, which ambushes and kills a <span>caiman</span>.  Deep in the jungle, animals provide camouflage and mimicry to help evade predators, such as a <span>leaf-tailed gecko</span> which disguises itself as lichen. A male <span>glass frog</span> from <span>Costa Rica</span> fiercely protects his eggs from predatory <span>wasps</span>. Some of the newly hatched tadpoles escape by falling into the stream below. At night, insects glow to search for mates while fungi use bioluminescent light to attract insects like <span>click beetles</span> to disperse their spores.

In the <span>Serengeti</span>, herds consisting of millions of <span>blue wildebeest</span> migrate across the savanna in pursuit of rain along with <span>Jackson's widowbirds</span>, not only to seek food but to mate. A male widowbird tears off grasses to create an even surface and a centerpiece stage to attract females while facing competition with rivals. <span>Leafcutter ant</span> colonies in South America continuously harvest vast amounts of grasses to furnish their horticulture with fungi providing enough nutrients to feed for the entire colony. In northern <span>Australia</span>, colonies of <span>compass termites</span> build multiple giant mounds that serve as a compass facing the north-south axis, which also protects them from mass flooding and extreme heat. On the plains of <span>South America</span>, a <span>giant anteater</span> digs up a termite mound and consumes 2000 of them a day. As fire ravages the grassland, the grass stems survive underground and continue to recover before raining season. In the <span>prairies</span> of North America during winter, <span>American bison</span> wrestle with starvation and endure frigid conditions as they shovel thick snow for buried grasses while a <span>red fox</span> finds a <span>vole</span> hidden within the snow. In the <span>Arctic</span> <span>tundra</span> during spring, 500 miles from the prairies, female <span>caribous</span> migrate to the north to give birth as the calves learn to sprint and gallop while joining their mothers for their ongoing migration. Unaware the danger the herds are heading to, a pack of <span>Arctic wolves</span> ambush them and one of the wolves manages to separate a calf but the calf uses its stamina to outrun the wolf before rejoining the herd. As the caribous travel onward to find their feeding ground, the narrator speculates that the grassland provides a great gathering of wildlife on Earth.</p>The <i>Planet Earth II Diaries</i> reveal the teams' exploration in <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Kaziranga</span> of <span>North India</span>, using hidden camera traps to avoid their encounter with Indian elephants, <span>water buffalos</span>, <span>Bengal tigers</span> and <span>Indian rhinoceros</span> while filming them.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep6\" style=\"text-align:center\">6</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Cities\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Fredi Devas</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">11 December 2016</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">11.10</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #000000\"><p>The last episode focuses on the urban environment as animals struggle to contend with their coexistence with humans. In <span>Jodhpur</span>, a bachelor gang of <span>gray langurs</span> jump across the rooftops to compete with an alpha male as he successfully expels them from his territory. Aftermath, they settle on the sacred temple garden which serves as a feeding ground for them and peaceful coexistence with <span>Hindus</span> resulting in increased breeding. <span>Peregrine falcons</span> settle on the highest perches in <span>New York City</span> as they soar across the street to hunt down <span class=\"mw-redirect\">pigeons</span>. At night, an <span>Indian leopard</span> prowls across the streets of <span>Mumbai</span> as it stalks on feral urban <span>pigs</span>. During the hot summer of <span>Rome</span>, a flock of one million <span>common starlings</span> gather in the evening after feeding as they return to their roosting tree while performing aerobatic murmurations. While building a bower for glamour to impress a female, a male <span>great bowerbird</span> settles on the golf course of <span>Townsville</span> to collect man-made objects for support as it raids the rival's collection before being deceived. During springtime in <span>Toronto</span>, a family of urban <span>raccoons</span> settle in the chimney for warmth as they explore urban areas while searching for their new home, under their mother's supervision. A troop of <span>rhesus macaques</span> settles in the crowded marketplace of <span>Jaipur</span>, as they raid food from the market. At night, a clan of competitive <span>spotted hyenas</span> ventures into the walled city of <span>Harar</span> which they provide a traditional coexistence with the <span>Harari people</span> during their 400 years of feeding carcasses and leftovers. Pigeons gather at the river near <span>Albi</span> to preen their feathers before they were ambushed by a <span>wels catfish</span>, a species that was introduced in the area since the 1970s. As cities began to expand, they also provide electricity resulting in light pollution that affect wildlife activities. On the coastline of <span>Barbados</span> at night, endangered <span>hawksbill sea turtle</span> hatchlings used their instinct to follow the moonlight before reaching the sea while others wander aimlessly into the city streets because of the confusion of city lights. Unlike other cities that decimated wildlife, there are other urban areas that cope with nature's coexistence. In <span>Milan</span>, residents present a solution to support nature by building urban forestation like the <span>Bosco Verticale</span> that contains more than 900 trees. In <span>Singapore</span>, two million trees have been planted over 45 years in urban areas, including the Supertree Grove in <span>Gardens by the Bay</span>, which are home to several exotic ferns and vines among other plants. It is also a suitable settlement for wildlife, such as <span>smooth-coated otters</span>.

My home, too, is here, in the city of London. Looking down on this great metropolis, the ingenuity with which we continue to reshape the surface of our planet is very striking. But it's also sobering. It reminds me of just how easy it is for us to lose our connection with the natural world. Yet, it's on this connection that the future of both humanity and the natural world will depend. And surely, it is our responsibility to do everything within our power to create a planet that provides a home not just for us, but for all life on Earth.\"— David Attenborough, in closing</blockquote><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Critical reception</h4><p>On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of 28 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Planet Earth II offers a spectacular, moving, unprecedented account of the natural world.\"</p><p>The Independent's Christopher Hooton said of the series: \"It is undoubtedly the greatest TV nature documentary to date and there's a strong case for it being one of the best TV series full stop.\" Michael Hogan from The Telegraph compared this series to the original Planet Earth series and said that \"advances in technology have enabled intimate high-definition close-ups and gasp-inducing aerial shots\" and said \"It has become predictable to heap superlatives upon the BBC Natural History Unit and wax lyrical about Attenborough's status. But both institutions should be treasured while we're lucky enough to still have them.\" Gerard O'Donovan gave the series 5 out of 5 stars in The Telegraph, calling it \"one of the most stunningly vivid and engaging natural history films I've ever seen\".</p><p>In The New York Times, Neil Glenzinger said \"nature photography has rarely been as spectacular as it is in Planet Earth II.\" The Hollywood Reporter's Tim Goodman called the series a \"truly sublime accomplishment, an epic achievement that everyone should watch.\"</p><p>Several outlets particularly highlighted the racer snake and marine iguana sequence from \"Islands\" as a memorable highlight of the series.</p><p>However, The Guardian's Martin Hughes-Games, while calling the series \"spectacular and fascinating\", accused programmes such as this of breeding complacency about the destruction of wildlife by painting a misleading picture of the planet. He wrote that series such as Planet Earth had \"become a disaster for the world's wildlife\" and that while world animal populations are decreasing, \"the producers continue to go to the fast shrinking parks and reserves to make their films – creating a beautiful, beguiling fantasy world\".</p><p>As of 2023, the series is the highest rated television series of all time on IMDb's list of Top Rated TV Shows. The Guardian listed the series as the best television show of 2016 and in 2019 ranked it along with the first Planet Earth series 72nd on a list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century.</p><h4>Awards and nominations</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th>Year</th><th>Award</th><th>Category</th><th>Nominee</th><th>Result</th><th class=\"unsortable\"><abbr title=\"References\">Ref.</abbr></th></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"26\">2017</td><td rowspan=\"2\"><span>British Academy Television Awards</span></td><td><span>Huw Wheldon Award for Specialist Factual</span></td><td><i>Planet Earth II</i></td><td style=\"background: #9EFF9E;

In 2021, the BBC ranked the series as the 58th greatest TV series of the 21st century.\r\nOverview\r\nChildren start vanishing from the German town of Winden, bringing to light the fractured relationships, double lives, and the dark pasts of four families living there, and unfurling a mystery that spans four generations.\r\nThe first season begins in 2019, but later grows to include 1986 and 1953 via time travel, when members of the show's central families become aware of a wormhole in the cave system beneath the local nuclear power plant. During the first season, secrets are revealed concerning the Kahnwald, Nielsen, Doppler, and Tiedemann families, and their lives begin crumbling as their ties are exposed. The conspiracy involves the missing children and the history of the town and its citizens.\r\nThe second season continues the intertwining families' attempts to reunite with their missing loved ones, several months after the first-season finale, in 2020, 1987 and 1954, respectively. Additional story-lines are set in 2053 and 1921. The second season introduces Sic Mundus Creatus Est, a major faction in the ongoing battle for the ultimate fate of the people of Winden and the world. The season counts down towards the apocalypse.\r\nThe third season follows the four families across time in the wake of the apocalypse in 2020. It introduces a parallel world tethered to the first. The third season continues the 1954, 1987, 2020 and 2053 storylines in the first world, while also adding a new 1888 storyline and 2019 and 2052 in the second world, as the factions further their own desires for each world. The season also showcases the main events between all of these years, continuing the events of the season while also serving as backstory for the events of the first two seasons.\r\nCast and characters\r\nThe first season takes place primarily in 2019 but expands to include stories set in 1986, 1953, and – in the final scene of the first season – 2052, with several characters portrayed at various ages by multiple actors.\r\nThe second season takes place several months after the first, depicting the initial stories in 2020, 1987, and 1954, respectively, while continuing the future-set storyline into 2053, and adding a fifth storyline, set in 1921.\r\nThe third season introduces a storyline based in 1888 and a parallel reality featuring alternate versions of many main characters.\r\nMain characters\r\nRecurring cast\r\nJennipher Antoni as Ulla Obendorf, Erik Obendorf's mother in 2019 (season 1)\r\nNils Brunkhorst as the high school's science teacher in 2019 (seasons 1, 3)\r\nLena Dörrie as Clara Schrage, a nurse attending to Helge Doppler in 2019 (season 1)\r\nTara Fischer as a friend of Katharina in 1986–1987 (seasons 1–3)\r\nLeopold Hornung as Torben Wöller, a junior police officer in 2019–2020, Benni/Bernadette's brother (seasons 1–3)\r\nTom Jahn as Jürgen Obendorf, Erik Obendorf's father in 2019–2020 (seasons 1–3)\r\nAnna König as Edda Heimann, a pathologist in 2019 (seasons 1, 3)\r\nVico Mücke as Yasin Friese, Elisabeth Doppler's friend in 2019 (season 1)\r\nHenning Peker as Udo Meier, a pathologist in 1953–1954 (seasons 1–2)\r\nBarbara Philipp as Selma Ahrens, a caseworker in 1986 (season 1)\r\nPaul Radom as Erik Obendorf, a teenage drug dealer gone missing in 2019 (season 1)\r\nAnton Rubtsov as Benni/Bernadette, a transgender prostitute in 2019–2020, Torben's sister (seasons 1–3)\r\nSammy Scheuritzel as Kilian Obendorf, Erik Obendorf's brother and Martha and Bartosz's classmate in 2019's alternative world (seasons 1, 3)\r\nAnna Schönberg as Donata Kraus, a nurse and Ines Kahnwald's co-worker in 1986 (season 1)\r\nAndreas Schröders as a power plant worker in 2020 (season 2)\r\nMieke Schymura as Justyna Jankowski, a junior police officer in 2019–2020 (seasons 1–3)\r\nAxel Werner as Gustav Tannhaus, H.G.

On 26 April 2019, a second season was announced which was released on 21 June 2019.\r\nOn 26 May 2020, a third and final season was announced, which was released on 27 June 2020.\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nDark received critical acclaim and has been listed by many publications as one of the best TV shows of the years 2017, 2019, and 2020, as well as of the 2010s, 21st century, and of all time. Vulture included the series in its article A Guide to TV Shows in the 2010s as one of the most notable shows of the decade. BBC ranked it the 58th best TV series of the 21st century. Meanwhile, BuzzFeed named it the 22nd best TV show of all time.\r\nSeason 1\r\nThe first season of Dark received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many noting its similarities to the TV series Twin Peaks and another Netflix series Stranger Things. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 89%, with an average rating of 7.4 out of 10, based on 46 critics. The website's critical consensus is \"Dark's central mystery unfolds slowly, both tense and terrifying, culminating in a creepy, cinematic triumph of sci-fi noir.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream publications, gave it a score of 61, based on ten reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\r\nWriting for The Guardian, Lanre Bakare gave Dark a rating of four out of five stars and praised the series for its tone, the complexity of its narrative, and its pacing. Grading the series with a \"B\", Steve Greene of IndieWire wrote, \"Even when Dark is clinical in its set-up of these interweaving story threads, there's still an incredible amount of energy coursing through the show.\" From Vox, Emily St. James gave it a score of three and a half out of five and said, \"Dark is fun to try to solve — it's a treat to tease out the many connections running among the three eras. It's just that at a certain point, it becomes difficult to care about what's happening, beyond simply wanting to figure out how everything is connected.\" Ariana Romero of Refinery29 noted that the series was darker and more in-depth than Stranger Things. However, there was some criticism by Reason's Glenn Garvin for a heavy-handed approach to its message, a lack of sympathetic characters, and unoriginality of certain aspects of the series.\r\nLos Angeles Times listed Dark as one of the best TV series of 2017, while Thrillist named it the 18th best TV show of the year.\r\nSeason 2\r\nThe second season received critical acclaim. Metacritic reported a score of 82 out of 100, based on four reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" At Rotten Tomatoes, season two of the series holds an approval rating of 100% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1 out of 10, with the \"Certified Fresh\" status. The website's critical consensus states, \"Dark's sumptuous second season descends deeper into the show's meticulously-crafted mythos and cements the series as one of streaming's strongest and strangest science fiction stories.\"\r\nCritics referred to season two as ominous and much more bizarre than season one, and that the series managed to subvert several tropes regarding the concepts of time travel. The season received a rating of four out of five stars from Jack Seale of The Guardian and Boyd Hilton of Empire, a \"B+\" grade from Hanh Nguyen of IndieWire, and an \"amazing\" score of 9 out of 10 from David Griffin of IGN. The latter wrote in his verdict: \"Dark Season 2 can hurt your brain at times, trying to piece all the time-traveling narratives together, but in the end, creators Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese reward your patience with some stellar WTF moments. At eight episodes in length, is a tightly-woven tapestry of compelling stories and memorable performances from the entire ensemble.\" TV Guide's Kaitlin Thomas was also favorable of the season, saying that \"one of the reasons Dark is such a compelling drama isn't just because it presents time travel as something that is possible or because it grounds its story in the emotional narratives of its characters, but because it couches its sci-fi themes in conversations about free will and destiny. excels at building a compelling mystery, and the fact that it never loses the plot itself is a testament to the writing of the series.\"\r\nThe season was included in many critics' year-end lists of 2019. It was ranked as the ninth and tenth best TV show of the year by Maggie Fremont of ScreenCrush and John Sellers of Thrillist, respectively. Outside the top ten, TV Guide and Complex named it the 12th and 26th best TV show of the year in their respective list. In addition, CNET and Vogue also listed it on each unranked list.\r\nSeason 3\r\nThe third and final season received critical acclaim, particularly for the series' ending, though the increased complexity of the plot drew some criticism. It received a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 97% based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5 out of 10, with the \"Certified Fresh\" status. The site's critical consensus says, \"Dark's final chapter is as thrilling as it is bewildering, bringing viewers full circle without sacrificing any of the show's narrative complexities.\" At Metacritic, the season received an average score of 92, based on four reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"\r\nThe season received a rating of five out of five stars from Radio Times's Patrick Cremona and four out of five stars from The Guardian's Jack Seale, an \"A-\" grade from IndieWire's Steve Greene, and an \"amazing\" 9 out of 10 from IGN's David Griffin. Cremona deemed it as \"science fiction at its most mesmerising, its most confounding and its most exhilarating - and it all makes for a truly irresistible piece of television\" and further praised the writing, cinematography, casting, and acting (particularly that of Louis Hoffman, Maja Schöne, and Lisa Vicari). Griffin wrote in his verdict, \"Dark's third and final season on Netflix is a memorable journey through time and space, with thrilling character shifts and fascinating paradoxes to unpack.\" William Goodman of Complex praised the ending, saying, \"Odar and Friese masterfully close by showing the symbiotic relationship between endings and beginnings. There's no victory without sacrifice, no light without darkness, and no love without loss. The tension between each of these conflicting ideas is so interwoven, making it hard to discern where one ends and the other begins. And so Dark concludes not with a hard endpoint on a line, but by elegantly and satisfyingly circling back into itself.\"\r\nThe season was listed by many publications as one of the best TV shows of 2020. Radio Times named it the eighth best TV show of the year, with one of the website's writers Patrick Cremona saying, \"The final series was another irresistible piece of sci-fi television, equal parts mesmerising and confounding, with a sweeping scope that gave it the sense of a true epic. With its exhilarating finale, Dark has earned its place among the list of the very best original series made for the streamer.\" Exclaim! ranked it the tenth best TV series of the year. The website's Allie Gregory wrote, \"With stunning performances from Louis Hoffman, Oliver Masucci and Karoline Eichhorn (and an incredible score to boot), the apocalyptic time travel sci-fi series deftly concludes its mind-bending journey in its darkest (and Dark-est) instalment yet. manages to neatly tie up all of its loose ends to finally find the one true \"origin,\" so, at last, the town of Winden can free itself from the trappings of time and fate.\" GameSpot listed it as one of the year's ten best TV shows, with one of its writers Mike Rougeau stating, \"what really impressed us about Season 3 is how it wrapped things up, even while continuing the tradition of adding yet another new dimension (so to speak) to the show's tangled timelines. It managed to weave one of the most complex, but somehow still cohesive, sci-fi stories we've ever seen.\" Outside the top ten, Den of Geek named it the 17th best TV show of 2020. Meanwhile, Thrillist ranked it at number 19 on its \"40 Best TV Shows of 2020\" list, with one of its writers Emma Stefansky calling the series finale \"one of the most shocking and emotional conclusions to a TV show you'll see this year.\"\r\nAwards and nominations\r\nThe series was nominated for the Goldene Kamera TV awards 2018 in three categories: best series; best actress for Karoline Eichhorn as Charlotte Doppler; and best actor for Oliver Masucci as Ulrich Nielsen. None of these nominations resulted in awards, but Louis Hofmann received the \"Best Newcomer\" award in recognition of his lead role in Dark as well as his performances in several films.\r\nThe series was awarded the 2018 Grimme-Preis award in the category \"Fiction\", which singled out the following cast and crew for awards:\r\nThe actors named are awarded as \"representatives for the full cast\".",
      "html": "<p>Dark is a German science fiction thriller television series co-created by Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese. It ran for three seasons from 2017 to 2020. The story follows characters from the fictional town of Winden, Germany, as they pursue the truth in the aftermath of a child's disappearance. They follow connections between four estranged families to unravel a sinister time travel conspiracy which spans several generations. The series explores the existential implications of time and its effect on human nature. It features an ensemble cast.</p><p>Dark debuted on 1 December 2017 on Netflix; it is the service's first German-language original series. The second season was released on 21 June 2019, while the third and final season was released on 27 June 2020.</p><p>Dark received widespread critical acclaim for its cast, direction, writing, tone, visuals, musical score, and the ambition and complexity of its narrative. The series' finale received particular praise, with many calling it a \"satisfying\" conclusion. In 2021, the BBC ranked the series as the 58th greatest TV series of the 21st century.</p><br/><h3>Overview</h3><p>Children start vanishing from the German town of Winden, bringing to light the fractured relationships, double lives, and the dark pasts of four families living there, and unfurling a mystery that spans four generations.</p><p>The first season begins in 2019, but later grows to include 1986 and 1953 via time travel, when members of the show's central families become aware of a wormhole in the cave system beneath the local nuclear power plant. During the first season, secrets are revealed concerning the Kahnwald, Nielsen, Doppler, and Tiedemann families, and their lives begin crumbling as their ties are exposed. The conspiracy involves the missing children and the history of the town and its citizens.</p><p>The second season continues the intertwining families' attempts to reunite with their missing loved ones, several months after the first-season finale, in 2020, 1987 and 1954, respectively. Additional story-lines are set in 2053 and 1921. The second season introduces Sic Mundus Creatus Est, a major faction in the ongoing battle for the ultimate fate of the people of Winden and the world. The season counts down towards the apocalypse.</p><p>The third season follows the four families across time in the wake of the apocalypse in 2020. It introduces a parallel world tethered to the first. The third season continues the 1954, 1987, 2020 and 2053 storylines in the first world, while also adding a new 1888 storyline and 2019 and 2052 in the second world, as the factions further their own desires for each world. The season also showcases the main events between all of these years, continuing the events of the season while also serving as backstory for the events of the first two seasons.</p><br/><h3>Cast and characters</h3><p>The first season takes place primarily in 2019 but expands to include stories set in 1986, 1953, and – in the final scene of the first season – 2052, with several characters portrayed at various ages by multiple actors.</p><p>The second season takes place several months after the first, depicting the initial stories in 2020, 1987, and 1954, respectively, while continuing the future-set storyline into 2053, and adding a fifth storyline, set in 1921.</p><p>The third season introduces a storyline based in 1888 and a parallel reality featuring alternate versions of many main characters.</p><h4>Main characters</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr style=\"background-color:#ADD8E6;\"><th rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18%;\" scope=\"col\">Character</th><th rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:7%;\" scope=\"col\">Life stage</th><th rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\">Description</th><th rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15%;\" scope=\"col\">Actor</th><th colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col\">Season</th></tr><tr><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\"><span data-sort-value=\"Kahnwald, Jonas\"><span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">Jonas Kahnwald</span></span></span></td><td><span data-sort-value=\"1 !\">Child</span></td><td>A young boy</td><td><span data-sort-value=\"Gerzabek, Jonas\"><span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">Jonas Gerzabek</span></span></span></td><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #EEE; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"table-cast\"><span style=\"display: none\">Does not appear</span></td><td style=\"background: #DEF; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"table-cast\"><span>Guest</span></td></tr><tr><td><span data-sort-value=\"2 !\">Teen</span></td><td>A high school student struggling with his father's suicide.

On 4 November, after nearly two months of treatment at a psychiatric facility, Michael's teenage son Jonas returns to school and reunites with his best friend Bartosz Tiedemann, who has recently started dating Martha Nielsen, whom Jonas has a crush on. Erik Obendorf, the local town drug dealer, has been missing for two weeks, and police officer Ulrich Nielsen – the father of Martha and her brothers, teenager Magnus and pre-teen Mikkel – has been assigned the investigation, which struggles to uncover any clues. Meanwhile, Ulrich is cheating on his wife Katharina, the principal of the school, with Jonas's mother Hannah. While searching for Erik's stash of drugs in a cave not far from the town's soon-to-be-closed-down nuclear power plant, Jonas, Bartosz, the three Nielsen children, and Magnus' girlfriend Franziska are frightened by strange sounds and their flickering flashlights, and Mikkel disappears as they flee the cave. The next day, the body of a young boy is discovered, but it is not Mikkel.

Police chief Charlotte Doppler is informed that the dead boy, dressed in a 1980s outfit, died only 16 hours earlier, and that his ears were destroyed by extreme pressure. Later, as lights start flickering and birds fall dead from the sky, Charlotte grows even more concerned. Meanwhile, an unkempt stranger checks into the hotel owned by Bartosz's mother Regina.

Vulture included the series in its article A Guide to TV Shows in the 2010s as one of the most notable shows of the decade. BBC ranked it the 58th best TV series of the 21st century. Meanwhile, BuzzFeed named it the 22nd best TV show of all time.</p><h4>Season 1</h4><p>The first season of Dark received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many noting its similarities to the TV series Twin Peaks and another Netflix series Stranger Things. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 89%, with an average rating of 7.4 out of 10, based on 46 critics. The website's critical consensus is \"Dark's central mystery unfolds slowly, both tense and terrifying, culminating in a creepy, cinematic triumph of sci-fi noir.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream publications, gave it a score of 61, based on ten reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"</p><p>Writing for The Guardian, Lanre Bakare gave Dark a rating of four out of five stars and praised the series for its tone, the complexity of its narrative, and its pacing. Grading the series with a \"B\", Steve Greene of IndieWire wrote, \"Even when Dark is clinical in its set-up of these interweaving story threads, there's still an incredible amount of energy coursing through the show.\" From Vox, Emily St. James gave it a score of three and a half out of five and said, \"Dark is fun to try to solve — it's a treat to tease out the many connections running among the three eras. It's just that at a certain point, it becomes difficult to care about what's happening, beyond simply wanting to figure out how everything is connected.\" Ariana Romero of Refinery29 noted that the series was darker and more in-depth than Stranger Things. However, there was some criticism by Reason's Glenn Garvin for a heavy-handed approach to its message, a lack of sympathetic characters, and unoriginality of certain aspects of the series.</p><p>Los Angeles Times listed Dark as one of the best TV series of 2017, while Thrillist named it the 18th best TV show of the year.</p><h4>Season 2</h4><p>The second season received critical acclaim. Metacritic reported a score of 82 out of 100, based on four reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" At Rotten Tomatoes, season two of the series holds an approval rating of 100% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1 out of 10, with the \"Certified Fresh\" status. The website's critical consensus states, \"Dark's sumptuous second season descends deeper into the show's meticulously-crafted mythos and cements the series as one of streaming's strongest and strangest science fiction stories.\"</p><p>Critics referred to season two as ominous and much more bizarre than season one, and that the series managed to subvert several tropes regarding the concepts of time travel. The season received a rating of four out of five stars from Jack Seale of The Guardian and Boyd Hilton of Empire, a \"B+\" grade from Hanh Nguyen of IndieWire, and an \"amazing\" score of 9 out of 10 from David Griffin of IGN. The latter wrote in his verdict: \"Dark Season 2 can hurt your brain at times, trying to piece all the time-traveling narratives together, but in the end, creators Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese reward your patience with some stellar WTF moments. At eight episodes in length, is a tightly-woven tapestry of compelling stories and memorable performances from the entire ensemble.\" TV Guide's Kaitlin Thomas was also favorable of the season, saying that \"one of the reasons Dark is such a compelling drama isn't just because it presents time travel as something that is possible or because it grounds its story in the emotional narratives of its characters, but because it couches its sci-fi themes in conversations about free will and destiny. excels at building a compelling mystery, and the fact that it never loses the plot itself is a testament to the writing of the series.\"</p><p>The season was included in many critics' year-end lists of 2019. It was ranked as the ninth and tenth best TV show of the year by Maggie Fremont of ScreenCrush and John Sellers of Thrillist, respectively. Outside the top ten, TV Guide and Complex named it the 12th and 26th best TV show of the year in their respective list. In addition, CNET and Vogue also listed it on each unranked list.</p><h4>Season 3</h4><p>The third and final season received critical acclaim, particularly for the series' ending, though the increased complexity of the plot drew some criticism. It received a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 97% based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5 out of 10, with the \"Certified Fresh\" status. The site's critical consensus says, \"Dark's final chapter is as thrilling as it is bewildering, bringing viewers full circle without sacrificing any of the show's narrative complexities.\" At Metacritic, the season received an average score of 92, based on four reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"</p><p>The season received a rating of five out of five stars from Radio Times's Patrick Cremona and four out of five stars from The Guardian's Jack Seale, an \"A-\" grade from IndieWire's Steve Greene, and an \"amazing\" 9 out of 10 from IGN's David Griffin. Cremona deemed it as \"science fiction at its most mesmerising, its most confounding and its most exhilarating - and it all makes for a truly irresistible piece of television\" and further praised the writing, cinematography, casting, and acting (particularly that of Louis Hoffman, Maja Schöne, and Lisa Vicari). Griffin wrote in his verdict, \"Dark's third and final season on Netflix is a memorable journey through time and space, with thrilling character shifts and fascinating paradoxes to unpack.\" William Goodman of Complex praised the ending, saying, \"Odar and Friese masterfully close by showing the symbiotic relationship between endings and beginnings. There's no victory without sacrifice, no light without darkness, and no love without loss. The tension between each of these conflicting ideas is so interwoven, making it hard to discern where one ends and the other begins. And so Dark concludes not with a hard endpoint on a line, but by elegantly and satisfyingly circling back into itself.\"</p><p>The season was listed by many publications as one of the best TV shows of 2020. Radio Times named it the eighth best TV show of the year, with one of the website's writers Patrick Cremona saying, \"The final series was another irresistible piece of sci-fi television, equal parts mesmerising and confounding, with a sweeping scope that gave it the sense of a true epic. With its exhilarating finale, Dark has earned its place among the list of the very best original series made for the streamer.\" Exclaim! ranked it the tenth best TV series of the year. The website's Allie Gregory wrote, \"With stunning performances from Louis Hoffman, Oliver Masucci and Karoline Eichhorn (and an incredible score to boot), the apocalyptic time travel sci-fi series deftly concludes its mind-bending journey in its darkest (and Dark-est) instalment yet. manages to neatly tie up all of its loose ends to finally find the one true \"origin,\" so, at last, the town of Winden can free itself from the trappings of time and fate.\" GameSpot listed it as one of the year's ten best TV shows, with one of its writers Mike Rougeau stating, \"what really impressed us about Season 3 is how it wrapped things up, even while continuing the tradition of adding yet another new dimension (so to speak) to the show's tangled timelines. It managed to weave one of the most complex, but somehow still cohesive, sci-fi stories we've ever seen.\" Outside the top ten, Den of Geek named it the 17th best TV show of 2020. Meanwhile, Thrillist ranked it at number 19 on its \"40 Best TV Shows of 2020\" list, with one of its writers Emma Stefansky calling the series finale \"one of the most shocking and emotional conclusions to a TV show you'll see this year.\"</p><h4>Awards and nominations</h4><p>The series was nominated for the Goldene Kamera TV awards 2018 in three categories: best series; best actress for Karoline Eichhorn as Charlotte Doppler; and best actor for Oliver Masucci as Ulrich Nielsen. None of these nominations resulted in awards, but Louis Hofmann received the \"Best Newcomer\" award in recognition of his lead role in Dark as well as his performances in several films.</p><p>The series was awarded the 2018 Grimme-Preis award in the category \"Fiction\", which singled out the following cast and crew for awards:</p><p>The actors named are awarded as \"representatives for the full cast\".</p><br/>"

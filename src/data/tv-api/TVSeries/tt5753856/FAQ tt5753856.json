      "question": "What was the link between Noah/Helge and Tannhaus in regards to testing time travel with the three boys? Why were the boys killed?",
      "answer": "There was no relation between Noah and Helge's doings and H.G. Tannhaus's machine. Tannhaus built his machine in the original world which got destroyed the first time he started it. The machine in fact led to the creation of the two worlds we got to see (Adam's and Eve's).In one of the episodes of season 2 Adam explained to Jonas that each step was important in eventually leading to the creation of the machine he used to travel (the one that hit the black hole blob with lightning). In order for it to come to existence someone first needed to experiment with other, cruder machines (such as the ones we see Noah operate). The final version of the machine (Adam's) would not have existed were it not for Noah's experiments.Adam knows this as it is written in the Triquerta book and he wants events from it to repeat up until he gets a chance to destroy the origin. That is why he sends Noah to 1986 and gives him the book. Thus Noah knows who he should kidnap and it is pretty much certain he also knows three of the boys will die in the process. It does not mean he wants them to die, but he thinks this is necessary to achieve the greater goal.Chronologically, Jonas was the last kidnapped person. However, due to the Stranger (older Jonas) meddling with the Black hole he got switched with Helge from 1953. And Helge was the first boy to successfully travel through time without dying (back from 1986 to 1953). You can also see that the machine Noah used on him was different to the one he used on the others (part of the machine's evolution). This also helped create a bond between Helge and Noah (we see them hug in 1953) which Noah later used to get adult Helge (from 1986) to help with the whole thing."

      "question": "How was Jonas / Adam's face disfigured and when ?",
      "answer": "It is heavily suggested he got disfigured while experimenting on the time machine post-1888. We see a scene where his arm got heavily burned and the scars on his face seem like burn scars. He was evidently not afraid for his life ever since Noah explained that Jonas/Adam could not die given that his older self was alive. This, in essence, meant the Stranger could participate in any experiment, no matter how dangerous."

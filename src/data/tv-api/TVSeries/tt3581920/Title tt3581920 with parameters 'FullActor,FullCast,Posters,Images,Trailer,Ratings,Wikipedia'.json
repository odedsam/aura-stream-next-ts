In January 2023, the series was renewed for a second season.\r\nCast and characters\r\nMain\r\nPedro Pascal as Joel, a hardened middle-aged survivor who is tormented by the trauma of his past. Joel is tasked with smuggling a young girl, Ellie, out of a quarantine zone and across the United States. Joel is more vulnerable in the series—he is hard of hearing in one ear due to a gunshot and his knees ache when he stands.\r\nBella Ramsey as Ellie, a 14-year-old girl who displays much defiance and anger but has a private need for kinship and belonging. She has not lost her playfulness, bonding easily with children, and has a fondness for puns. She is immune to the Cordyceps infection and may be the key to creating a vaccine.\r\nGuest\r\nNico Parker as Sarah, Joel's 14-year-old daughter. She cares for her father, playfully teasing him over his behavior and attitude.\r\nJohn Hannah as Dr. Newman, an epidemiologist who issues a warning about the threat of fungi during a talk show in 1968.\r\nMerle Dandridge as Marlene, the head of the Fireflies, a resistance movement hoping to gain freedom from the military. Dandridge reprises her role from the games.\r\nChristopher Heyerdahl as Dr. Schoenheist, an epidemiologist on the 1968 talk show who is skeptical of Newman's warning.\r\nBrendan Fletcher as Robert, a thug and black market arms dealer in the Boston Quarantine Zone. Robert fears Joel's retribution against his actions.\r\nAnna Torv as Tess, a hardened survivor and Joel's smuggler partner. Tess is respected in the Boston Quarantine Zone, largely out of fear. She is protective of Ellie during their escort mission.\r\nGabriel Luna as Tommy, Joel's younger brother and a former soldier who maintains idealism in his hope for a better world. Tommy was recruited to the Fireflies but gave up on their cause.\r\nChristine Hakim as Ratna Pertiwi, a mycology professor at the University of Indonesia who advises the government to bomb Jakarta to slow the spread of the infection, for which she feels hopeless.\r\nNick Offerman as Bill, a misanthropic survivalist who lives with Frank. Bill's paranoia and distrust of the government left him prepared for the pandemic, protected in a secure underground bunker.\r\nMurray Bartlett as Frank, a survivalist living in an isolated town with Bill. Frank is friendlier and more trusting than Bill, wanting to beautify their town and create friendships with Tess and Joel.\r\nLamar Johnson as Henry Burrell, who is hiding from a revolutionary movement in Kansas City. Henry is hurt by his own actions but ultimately does them to protect his younger brother Sam.\r\nMelanie Lynskey as Kathleen Coghlan, the leader of a revolutionary movement in Kansas City. Kathleen is soft spoken and outwardly sweet but an intelligent and fierce leader.\r\nKeivonn Montreal Woodard as Sam, a deaf, artistic eight-year-old child who is hiding with his brother Henry. Sam was diagnosed with leukemia at a young age.\r\nJeffrey Pierce as Perry, a revolutionary rebel in a quarantine zone who is Kathleen's right-hand man. Pierce portrayed Tommy in the video games. Perry is a former military member.\r\nJohn Getz as Eldelstein, a Kansas City doctor who protects Henry and Sam from Kathleen and the revolutionary rebels.\r\nRutina Wesley as Maria, a leading member of a settlement in Jackson and Tommy's pregnant wife. Formerly an assistant district attorney, Maria is a calm and merciful leader.\r\nGraham Greene as Marlon, a Native American hunter who has lived with his wife Florence in the wilderness of Wyoming since before the pandemic. Marlon is resourceful and untrusting of strangers.\r\nElaine Miles as Florence, who lives with her husband Marlon. Florence is calm and humorous. Unlike Marlon, she did not want to isolate in the wilderness.\r\nStorm Reid as Riley Abel, an orphaned girl who is Ellie's best friend at military school in post-apocalyptic Boston. Riley ran away from military school to join the Fireflies, considering the former fascists.\r\nScott Shepherd as David, a preacher who is the leader of a religious group. David is calm and acts as a caring leader, but is manipulative and abusive to remind members of his leadership status. He claims to have found God after the outbreak.\r\nTroy Baker as James, David's right-hand man. Baker previously portrayed Joel in the video games. James lacks faith in David but wants to be considered his equal, feeling threatened when Ellie's capabilities threaten to usurp his position.\r\nAshley Johnson as Anna, Ellie's mother. Johnson previously portrayed Ellie in the video games. Anna is resourceful, killing an infected while giving birth. She is close with Marlene; upon giving birth to Ellie, she tasks Marlene with caring for Ellie.\r\nEpisodes\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nA film adaptation of Naughty Dog's 2013 video game The Last of Us was announced in March 2014, to be written by the game's writer and creative director Neil Druckmann; it had entered development hell by 2016, and the partnership ended and rights relinquished by 2019. Due to the extensive development of a film based on Uncharted, another game series by Naughty Dog, Druckmann ensured specific plot points were included when negotiating a deal with film and television studios; he felt more closely connected to The Last of Us's creation and development than Uncharted's and always wanted to be involved in its adaptation in some manner. In 2018, writer and director Craig Mazin was approached by PlayStation Productions with a list of video games for potential television adaptation; he was disappointed to discover The Last of Us was being adapted into a film at the time as he felt television was a better fit. A fan of the video game, having played it about twelve times, Mazin was introduced to Druckmann through Shannon Woodward, a mutual friend, in 2019. Druckmann, a fan of Mazin's series Chernobyl, agreed with Mazin that The Last of Us required the length and pacing of a television series. They pitched the series to HBO about a week after meeting. HBO chairman and chief content officer Casey Bloys and head of drama programming Francesca Orsi were unfamiliar with the game but trusted Mazin due to his work on Chernobyl and his investment in the story and world.\r\nIn March 2020, a television adaptation was announced in the planning stages at HBO, expected to cover events of the first game. Mazin and Druckmann were named to write and executive produce the series, while television producer Carolyn Strauss and Naughty Dog president Evan Wells were named executive producers, and Gustavo Santaolalla, who worked on the games, the show's composer. The show was announced as a joint production of Sony Pictures Television, PlayStation Productions, and Naughty Dog; it is the first show produced by PlayStation Productions. It is produced under the company name Bear and Pear Productions. Johan Renck, Mazin's collaborator on Chernobyl, was announced as executive producer and director of the series premiere in June 2020; he dropped out by November due to scheduling conflicts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. HBO greenlit the series on November 20. PlayStation Productions's Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan were named executive producers, and Word Games a production company.\r\nIn January 2021, the Mighty Mint joined production, and Kantemir Balagov was announced as the pilot episode's director. He had been interested in adapting the game for years and was set to direct several opening episodes; in October 2022, Balagov said he left the project a year prior due to creative differences. Rose Lam was added as executive producer in February 2021. Pre-production in Calgary, Alberta, began on March 15; Mazin arrived in May. Ali Abbasi and Jasmila Žbanić were announced as directors in April. In July 2021, the Directors Guild of Canada revealed Peter Hoar was assigned to direct, followed in August by Mazin, in September by Druckmann, and in January 2022 by Liza Johnson and Jeremy Webb. In February, Druckmann confirmed he directed an episode and felt his experience reinforced and reflected his experience in directing games. After several months traveling between Calgary and Los Angeles, Druckmann struggled to fulfil obligations at Naughty Dog and returned home to advise remotely, feeling confident in Mazin. The season's original ten-episode count was reduced to nine during production; the first two were combined after Bloys felt the first would not compel viewers to return.\r\nThe Last of Us is believed to be the largest television production in Canadian history, expected to generate over CA$200 million in revenue for Alberta. Sources suggested the budget was between US$10 million and US$15 million per episode; The New Yorker claimed the series budget exceeded each of the first five seasons of Game of Thrones. Calgary film officials felt Alberta was chosen for production partly due to the government's 2021 decision to remove its tax credit cap of CA$10 million per project. Canadian artists union IATSE 212 claimed the production led to a 30 percent increase in union membership and employment. The first season covers the events of the first game and its downloadable expansion The Last of Us: Left Behind (2014); Druckmann and Mazin suggested a second season would immediately cover the sequel, The Last of Us Part II (2020), to avoid filler; Part II is expected to span the course of multiple seasons. He does not want the series to overtake the games. The writers ensured characters remained true to their developments in Part II in case the show received more seasons. On January 27, 2023, less than two weeks after the series premiere, HBO renewed the series for a second season.\r\nCasting\r\nCasting took place virtually through Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Casting director Victoria Thomas wanted to honor the game without being limited by it. Mazin and Thomas sought high-profile guest stars; Thomas said many of the actors \"don't usually do one-episode guest spots\". On February 10, 2021, Pascal and Ramsey were cast as Joel and Ellie. Earlier that day, it was reported Mahershala Ali was offered the role of Joel after Matthew McConaughey turned it down; The Hollywood Reporter noted Ali \"did circle a role\" in the show, but a deal was never formed. Any actresses considered for Ellie for the canceled film adaptation—such as Maisie Williams and Kaitlyn Dever—had aged out of consideration by the time the series was in production, resulting in a reset of candidates. The producers primarily sought actors who could embody Joel and Ellie individually as well as imitate their relationship.: 14:42 Though both were previously featured on HBO's Game of Thrones, Pascal and Ramsey had not met before the filming of The Last of Us began but found they had instant chemistry, which developed over the course of production.\r\nLuna's casting as Tommy was announced on April 15, 2021, and Dandridge was confirmed to reprise her role of Marlene from the video games on May 27. In May, Classic Casting circulated a casting call for extras from Calgary, Fort Macleod, High River, and Lethbridge; anyone over 18 could apply, and those with vehicles from 1995 to 2003 were recommended. It was announced Parker was cast as Sarah on June 30. Pierce, Bartlett, and O'Neill's casting as Perry, Frank, and Bill was announced on July 15, followed by Torv's as Tess on July 22. On December 5, 2021, Bartlett claimed Offerman would appear on the show in a role close to his; two days later, Offerman was announced to be playing Bill, replacing O'Neill who was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. On December 9, Žbanić revealed the casting of Greene, Miles, and Wesley.\r\nReid's casting as Riley Abel was announced on January 14, 2022. In February, Mazin distributed a casting call for a boy aged 8–14 who is deaf, black, and proficient in American Sign Language or Black American Sign Language; Deaf West Theatre confirmed this was for the character of Sam, to appear in two episodes filmed in March and April. In June, Druckmann announced Baker and Ashley Johnson would star in the series; their character names were revealed in December. Lamar Johnson and Woodard's casting as Henry and Sam was announced in August, alongside the official announcement of Greene and Miles as Marlon and Florence. Lynskey's casting as Kathleen was announced alongside the teaser trailer in September, while Shepherd's casting was revealed in the first trailer in December. Wesley's role as Maria was announced on January 9.\r\nAccording to Variety, casting for the second season was put on hold in May 2023 due to the Writers Guild of America strike; actors had been auditioning with scenes from The Last of Us Part II due to an absence of scripts.\r\nWriting\r\nA post-apocalyptic drama and thriller, the series was written by Mazin and Druckmann; Mazin wrote all episodes except the premiere and finale, which he co-wrote with Druckmann, and the seventh episode, written by Druckmann. Druckmann was convinced Mazin was the ideal creative partner for the series after witnessing his passion for the game's story; Druckmann referred to Mazin as the story's \"co-parent\". Mazin said the series may represent a paradigm shift for film and television adaptations of video games due to the strength of the narrative, noting \"it would only take 20 minutes on Google to realize The Last of Us is the Lawrence of Arabia of video game narratives\".\r\nDruckmann felt the most important element of adapting the game was to \"keep the soul\", particularly the character relationships, whereas the gameplay and action sequences were of minimal importance. Mazin said the changes were \"designed to fill things out and expand, not to undo, but rather to enhance\". He said the series would avoid episodic storylines, such as random encounters not present in the original story. Content cut from the game was added to the show, including the story of Ellie's mother, Anna, which Mazin found \"gorgeous\" and demanded its inclusion in the series.: 3:39 Druckmann said some scripts borrow dialogue directly from the game, while others deviate; some of the game's action-heavy sequences were changed to focus on character drama at the encouragement of HBO. Druckmann said the series was taking the opposite approach to adaptation than the film Uncharted (2022); while Uncharted tells a new story with moments from the games to give \"an Uncharted flavor\", The Last of Us is a closer adaptation, allowing alterations such as changing character perspectives in a manner unachievable in an immersive game. Unlike creating the games, Druckmann felt he was able to \"unplug\" from the characters when writing the show due to the immersive nature of video games. The writers found the series an opportunity to delve into backstories of characters who the game otherwise ignored, wanting to better understand their motivations.\r\nDruckmann was open to changing any aspects of the games but always wanted a strong reason, ensuring he and Mazin considered the impacts on events later in the narrative. The game's outbreak takes place in 2013, while its post-apocalyptic narrative occurs in 2033; this was changed to 2003 and 2023, as the writers felt the story taking place simultaneously with the show's release was more interesting and real, and did not fundamentally change the story. The writers added the outbreak's origins to the series to ground the narrative; following COVID-19, they recognized audiences are more knowledgeable about viral pandemics than they once were. Borrowing from an approach he had used in writing Chernobyl, Mazin began the series with a segment of a fictional 1960s talk show explaining the origins of a fungal infection, implying humanity knew of the potential risk for some time. For the show, the writers removed spores as the vector through which the infection is spread in the games, replacing it with tendrils that form a unified, interconnected network, inspired by the idea of mycelium. The writers felt the game's gas masks did not translate well into television and spores were not a realistic threat, and found replacing it with an interconnected network increased tension. Visually, the fungal infection was inspired by jellyfish stings after Žbanić sent an image to Mazin during preproduction. The writers avoided making \"a zombie show\", acknowledging the infected creatures were ultimately a vessel through which the characters are pressured to make interesting decisions and reveal their true selves.\r\nA writers' room for the second season was established in Los Angeles by February 2023, and scripts were being written by April. Writing was impacted by the writers' strike in May; no scripts had been completed before the strike began, and neither Mazin nor Druckmann are working on the series while the strike is ongoing.\r\nFilming\r\nSupervising location manager Jason Nolan began preparation work for the series in January 2021, leading a 115-person team that found and transformed more than 180 locations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cast and crew quarantined for two weeks after entering Canada. Ksenia Sereda worked as cinematographer alongside Balagov, Mazin, Druckmann, and Johnson, Eben Bolter with Hoar and Webb, Christine A. Maier with Žbanić, and Nadim Carlsen with Abbasi. Sereda used an Alexa Mini with Cooke Optics S4 lenses; Bolter used the same as he felt it was effective for handheld shots while emulating 35 mm film. The series filmed for 200 days, with around 18–19 days per episode, amounting to 2–3 pages of script per day.\r\nFilming began in Calgary, Alberta, on July 12, a week later than originally scheduled. It moved to High River and Fort Macleod throughout the month—replicating Austin, Texas, for the first episode—before moving to Calgary in August. Balagov's work completed production by August 30, and Hoar's on October 5. Around CA$372,000 was spent for a four-day shoot in Downtown Edmonton in October, including at Rice Howard Way and the Alberta Legislature Building. Filming took place in downtown Calgary and Beltline later in October. Druckmann's episode was completed by November 7. In November, production occurred in Canmore, Alberta, replicating Jackson, Wyoming, and at Mount Royal University and the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. Žbanić's episode completed production by December 9.\r\nIn January 2022, Northland Village Mall in northwest Calgary was decorated for production. Filming took place in Okotoks and Waterton Lakes National Park in February, and Airport Trail in northeast Calgary saw closures for three days in March. Webb's episodes entered production in March 2022 and continued until the end of principal photography in June. Calgary was used to replicate Kansas City, Missouri in March. Production continued in Calgary in April and May, including around the Calgary Courts Centre, Kensington, and Victoria Park. Reshoots for Texas scenes took place in Olds in late May and early June, and High River in June. Production concluded in the early hours of June 11, two days later than originally scheduled; Additional photography took place in Kansas City on October 4.\r\nFilming for the second season is set to take place in British Columbia, including Vancouver. Production is planned to begin in early 2024.\r\nMusic\r\nSantaolalla and David Fleming composed the score for the television series; the former wrote its opening theme. He said Latino viewers \"will recognize touches\" of his music, and drew on his experiences in film and television, having composed the themes and some tracks for Jane the Virgin (2014–2019) and Making a Murderer (2015–2018). He primarily recrafted his previous work instead of creating new music, focusing on elements he found interesting. Fleming's work was inspired by real-world sounds within a decayed civilization. A 66-track soundtrack album for the series was released digitally on February 27.\r\nThe first episode uses songs like \"Tomorrow\" by Avril Lavigne and \"White Flag\" by Dido to foreshadow Sarah's fate and Joel's character arc. Its final scene and credits feature the song \"Never Let Me Down Again\" by Depeche Mode, which Mazin chose due to its blend of upbeat sounds and dark lyrics;: 40:25 the song returned in the sixth episode, performed by Mazin's daughter Jessica, to demonstrate Ellie feeling let down by Joel. The third episode uses \"Long, Long Time\" by Linda Ronstadt, which exhibits themes of unfulfilled love and how time heals wounds, echoing Bill and Frank's relationship. Streams of the song increased significantly following the episode's broadcast; several outlets compared it to the 2022 resurgence of Kate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill\" after its use in the fourth season of Stranger Things.\r\nThe fourth episode's title references the lyrics of \"Alone and Forsaken\" by Hank Williams, which is used in the episode;: 1:01 it was previously used in the original game and one of its trailers, and a trailer for the television series. The seventh episode features \"All or None\" by Pearl Jam to represent Ellie's loneliness and uncomfortability,: 7:28 reuses Etta James's version of \"I Got You Babe\" from The Last of Us: Left Behind as its romantic lyrics hidden by joyous music mirrored the feelings of Ellie and Riley,: 56:28 and uses A-ha's \"Take On Me\" to reflect their feelings towards each other and illustrate Ellie's journey; a cover version of \"Take On Me\" was used in a trailer for the series, and Ellie performs the song in The Last of Us Part II.\r\nDesign\r\nThe production team included five art directors and hundreds of technicians. The game's art director, concept artists, and environment artists provided feedback on costumes and sets. Costume designer Cynthia Ann Summers found the series more difficult than outfit-focused media like fantasy or period pieces as the costumes had to be integral to the story without standing out. She ensured Joel's outfits demonstrated a lack of consideration, as he would place little thought into his appearance; Mazin demanded specific colours. Summers required around 30 duplicates of each outfit to account for elements like blood and dirt progression, stunt doubles, and reserves. The breakdown department, responsible for disfiguring outfits as required by the story, was led by Sage Lovett. At the request of Mazin, Summers and her team focused on minor details relevant to an apocalyptic setting, like shoelaces replacing belts. Pascal and Ramsey were happy to wear regular outfits as they had both worked on science-fiction and period pieces.\r\nProduction designer John Paino referenced the video game but focused on references used by Naughty Dog during development. He created an image collage which included a photograph of reassembled chairs, which Mazin considered the show's mandate: \"the built world is unbuilt and rebuilt\". Paino found several Canadian towns had similarities to American architecture, particularly Texas. He was unable to locate empty and abandoned buildings or location imitating Boston's brick-lined streets for the first two episodes, requiring manual transformation and constructions. Paino and his team constructed the Boston quarantine zone near Stampede Park over several months for the first episode, the town of Lincoln in around six to twelve weeks for the third, and the Kansas City cul-de-sac in nine weeks for the fifth.\r\nBarrie and Sarah Gower, with whom Mazin had worked on Chernobyl, were engaged to create the prosthetics for the infected.: 0:31 Barrie Gower appreciated the series avoided \"stereotypical zombies—the pronounced cheekbones, sunken eyes, lots of blood and gore\". The production team created a large reference library for \"fuzz, slime mold, shelf mushrooms, button mushrooms, different textures and colors\". Mazin wanted the clickers to resemble the in-game design through prosthetics; he felt using visual effects would have lessened their impact.: 18:24 Their team found themselves continually referring to the original concept art from the game.: 0:44 For the approximately 70 actors portraying the infected mob in the fifth episode, 70 artists applied prosthetics to about 30 people in each three-hour shift. The 40 kilograms (88 lb) bloater suit was coated in an gel-like liquid during filming to appear wet and reflective. Paul Becker and Terry Notary choreographed the series. Notary wanted the creatures' movements to imitate each other, akin to schools of fish; for the fifth episode, he set up a boot camp to prepare the actors for the role.: 3:44 Misty Lee and Phillip Kovats, who had worked on the games, returned to voice the clickers for the series.\r\nPost-production\r\nThe series was edited by Timothy A. Good and Emily Mendez; Mark Hartzell edited the second episode, and Cindy Mollo edited the eighth. After Mazin worked on Chernobyl, Good expressed interest in collaborating; the two had been friends for some time. A different editor was employed for The Last of Us but departed due to scheduling conflicts; Good joined the series after finishing work on the third season of The Umbrella Academy.: 18:17 Mendez worked on the third episode as Good's assistant editor; he showed her work to Mazin, and they agreed for Mendez to co-edit the seventh episode as it adapted Left Behind, her favorite part of the games.

The season had over 3,000 visual effects shots; most episodes had around 250. The 650-person team at DNEG worked on 535 shots for the series over 18 months, primarily focusing on environmental effects, including the scenes set in Boston, Kansas City, Jackson, and Salt Lake City; field trips were conducted to gather resources, and the team regularly referenced the video games. The visual effects teams consulted with Naughty Dog's concept artists when creating the infected, and used timelapse videos of Cordyceps growth as animation references. All studios worked on the fifth episode's action sequence; the episode had around 350 to 400 visual effects shots. Wētā FX created the infected effects;: 41:05 50 to 70 creatures were digitally added to the horde. Design studio Elastic created the show's title sequence to demonstrate the \"unrelenting nature\" of the fungus; creative directors Andy Hall and Nadia Tzuo researched fungi to ensure an accurate depiction and movement. They pitched several ideas to Mazin and Druckmann before settling on the realistic depiction; Mazin enjoyed the idea of the fungus appearing beautiful despite its destructive nature.: 0:40\r\nRelease and promotion\r\nFor The Last of Us Day on September 26, 2021, HBO shared the first image of Pascal and Ramsey in costume, followed by the first still from the series at Summer Game Fest on June 10, 2022. The first footage of the show was revealed in a HBO Max trailer during the premiere of House of the Dragon on August 21, featuring Pascal, Ramsey, Parker, and Offerman. The decision to develop The Last of Us Part I—a remake of the original game—was partly based on the potential to introduce show viewers to the games; it was released for PlayStation 5 in September 2022, and for Windows in March 2023. The first teaser trailer for the show was released for The Last of Us Day on September 26, 2022, featuring the first footage of Luna, Dandridge, Torv, and Reid, and confirming Lynskey's casting; the teaser, which used Hank William's \"Alone and Forsaken\", received over 17 million views in less than 24 hours across Twitter and YouTube.\r\nWhile the series was originally indicated to begin airing in 2022, Bloys denied this in February 2022 and clarified it would begin in 2023, which was confirmed in the first teaser trailer.

The website's general consensus reads, \"Retaining the most addictive aspects of its beloved source material while digging deeper into the story, The Last of Us is bingeworthy TV that ranks among the all-time greatest video game adaptations.\" Metacritic calculated an average of 84 out of 100 based on 43 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Several reviewers considered it the best adaptation of a video game, with GameSpot's Mark Delaney saying it \"feels like the beginning of a new era\" for the genre.\r\nReviewers praised the differences from the original game's narrative implemented by Mazin and Druckmann, and some believed the scenes lifted directly from the game were among the weakest and led to issues with pacing. Variety's Daniel D'Addario felt the show relied too heavily on action sequences, while TechRadar's Axel Metz wanted more action. IGN's Simon Cardy wrote the series \"often shines brightest\" during its quietest moments. Critics overwhelmingly considered the third episode the season's best, and some named it among the greatest episodes of television overall. The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg felt it elevated the series to a new level, and Empire's John Nugent called it \"moving, surprisingly romantic, and one of the finest hours of television in recent memory\". Some critics found the first episode well-made but too familiar, and /Film's Valerie Ettenhofer considered it the season's weakest. RogerEbert.com's Brian Tallerico found the final two episodes rushed.\r\nSeveral critics lauded the production design. Digital Spy's David Opie wrote \"every set feels like it was ripped straight out of the game\". Conversely, Slant Magazine's Pat Brown felt environments appeared too manicured and carefully placed. Inverse's Dais Johnston praised the use of lighting to highlight the humanity of both the characters and creatures, and called the cinematography \"something other video game adaptations could only dream of\". TV Guide's Keith Phipps called the series \"visually striking\", and IGN's Cardy wrote it \"is often a sight to behold\". Santaolalla's score received praise, with CNET's Sean Keane feeling it added \"a yearning of sadness to the narrative\".\r\nThe cast's performances received widespread acclaim, with critics singling out the chemistry between Pascal and Ramsey for praise. Evening Standard's Vicky Jessop said the two \"steal every scene they're in\", while Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall called them \"compulsively watchable and almost instantly endearing\". Empire's Nugent and /Film's Ettenhofer referred to Pascal's performance as the best of his career, citing his ability to portray nuance and rare vulnerability. TechRadar's Metz described him as the \"perfect real-world manifestation\" of Joel. Several critics found Ramsey gave the show's breakout performance for their balance of comedy and emotion, with Time's Judy Berman calling them \"the show's greatest asset\" and IGN's Cardy applauding them for \"making mark\" on Ellie, a character already considered iconic long before Ramsey's portrayal. Some critics considered the seventh episode Ramsey's strongest.\r\nGuest performances throughout the season were highly praised. For the premiere, Rolling Stone's Sepinwall lauded Parker for \"holding the screen\" and establishing Sarah as likeable, and Push Square's Aaron Bayne wrote Luna flawlessly \"slips into the role\" with little screen time. Den of Geek's Bernard Boo found Torv in the second episode sophisticated and heartbreaking. Offerman and Bartlett's performances were described by Complex's William Goodman as \"career-best\" and by Inverse's Johnston as Emmy-worthy. Lynskey's performance in the fourth and fifth episodes was praised for juxtaposing humanity and viciousness. For the fifth episode, IGN's Cardy lauded Johnson's emotional performance in his final scene, and Total Film's Bradley Russell felt the naivety of Woodard's role intensified the narrative. Critics enjoyed Pascal and Luna's chemistry in the sixth episode, and Ramsey and Reid's in the seventh; Bleeding Cool's Tom Chang called the latter two \"award-worthy\", and Push Square's Bayne felt Reid effectively captured Riley's sense of \"youthful pride\". The A.V. Club's David Cote called Shepherd's performance \"masterful in its wry, understated charm\".\r\nRatings\r\nThe premiere episode had 4.7 million viewers in the United States on its first night of availability, including linear viewers and streams on HBO Max, making it the second-largest debut for HBO since 2010, behind House of the Dragon.

Due to the extensive development of a film based on Uncharted, another game series by Naughty Dog, Druckmann ensured specific plot points were included when negotiating a deal with film and television studios; he felt more closely connected to The Last of Us's creation and development than Uncharted's and always wanted to be involved in its adaptation in some manner. In 2018, writer and director Craig Mazin was approached by PlayStation Productions with a list of video games for potential television adaptation; he was disappointed to discover The Last of Us was being adapted into a film at the time as he felt television was a better fit. A fan of the video game, having played it about twelve times, Mazin was introduced to Druckmann through Shannon Woodward, a mutual friend, in 2019. Druckmann, a fan of Mazin's series Chernobyl, agreed with Mazin that The Last of Us required the length and pacing of a television series. They pitched the series to HBO about a week after meeting. HBO chairman and chief content officer Casey Bloys and head of drama programming Francesca Orsi were unfamiliar with the game but trusted Mazin due to his work on Chernobyl and his investment in the story and world.</p><p>In March 2020, a television adaptation was announced in the planning stages at HBO, expected to cover events of the first game. Mazin and Druckmann were named to write and executive produce the series, while television producer Carolyn Strauss and Naughty Dog president Evan Wells were named executive producers, and Gustavo Santaolalla, who worked on the games, the show's composer. The show was announced as a joint production of Sony Pictures Television, PlayStation Productions, and Naughty Dog; it is the first show produced by PlayStation Productions. It is produced under the company name Bear and Pear Productions. Johan Renck, Mazin's collaborator on Chernobyl, was announced as executive producer and director of the series premiere in June 2020; he dropped out by November due to scheduling conflicts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. HBO greenlit the series on November 20. PlayStation Productions's Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan were named executive producers, and Word Games a production company.</p><p>In January 2021, the Mighty Mint joined production, and Kantemir Balagov was announced as the pilot episode's director. He had been interested in adapting the game for years and was set to direct several opening episodes; in October 2022, Balagov said he left the project a year prior due to creative differences. Rose Lam was added as executive producer in February 2021. Pre-production in Calgary, Alberta, began on March 15; Mazin arrived in May. Ali Abbasi and Jasmila Žbanić were announced as directors in April. In July 2021, the Directors Guild of Canada revealed Peter Hoar was assigned to direct, followed in August by Mazin, in September by Druckmann, and in January 2022 by Liza Johnson and Jeremy Webb. In February, Druckmann confirmed he directed an episode and felt his experience reinforced and reflected his experience in directing games. After several months traveling between Calgary and Los Angeles, Druckmann struggled to fulfil obligations at Naughty Dog and returned home to advise remotely, feeling confident in Mazin. The season's original ten-episode count was reduced to nine during production; the first two were combined after Bloys felt the first would not compel viewers to return.</p><p>The Last of Us is believed to be the largest television production in Canadian history, expected to generate over CA$200 million in revenue for Alberta. Sources suggested the budget was between US$10 million and US$15 million per episode; The New Yorker claimed the series budget exceeded each of the first five seasons of Game of Thrones. Calgary film officials felt Alberta was chosen for production partly due to the government's 2021 decision to remove its tax credit cap of CA$10 million per project. Canadian artists union IATSE 212 claimed the production led to a 30 percent increase in union membership and employment. The first season covers the events of the first game and its downloadable expansion The Last of Us: Left Behind (2014); Druckmann and Mazin suggested a second season would immediately cover the sequel, The Last of Us Part II (2020), to avoid filler; Part II is expected to span the course of multiple seasons. He does not want the series to overtake the games. The writers ensured characters remained true to their developments in Part II in case the show received more seasons. On January 27, 2023, less than two weeks after the series premiere, HBO renewed the series for a second season.</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>Casting took place virtually through Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Casting director Victoria Thomas wanted to honor the game without being limited by it. Mazin and Thomas sought high-profile guest stars; Thomas said many of the actors \"don't usually do one-episode guest spots\". On February 10, 2021, Pascal and Ramsey were cast as Joel and Ellie. Earlier that day, it was reported Mahershala Ali was offered the role of Joel after Matthew McConaughey turned it down; The Hollywood Reporter noted Ali \"did circle a role\" in the show, but a deal was never formed. Any actresses considered for Ellie for the canceled film adaptation—such as Maisie Williams and Kaitlyn Dever—had aged out of consideration by the time the series was in production, resulting in a reset of candidates. The producers primarily sought actors who could embody Joel and Ellie individually as well as imitate their relationship.: 14:42 Though both were previously featured on HBO's Game of Thrones, Pascal and Ramsey had not met before the filming of The Last of Us began but found they had instant chemistry, which developed over the course of production.</p><p>Luna's casting as Tommy was announced on April 15, 2021, and Dandridge was confirmed to reprise her role of Marlene from the video games on May 27. In May, Classic Casting circulated a casting call for extras from Calgary, Fort Macleod, High River, and Lethbridge; anyone over 18 could apply, and those with vehicles from 1995 to 2003 were recommended. It was announced Parker was cast as Sarah on June 30. Pierce, Bartlett, and O'Neill's casting as Perry, Frank, and Bill was announced on July 15, followed by Torv's as Tess on July 22. On December 5, 2021, Bartlett claimed Offerman would appear on the show in a role close to his; two days later, Offerman was announced to be playing Bill, replacing O'Neill who was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. On December 9, Žbanić revealed the casting of Greene, Miles, and Wesley.</p><p>Reid's casting as Riley Abel was announced on January 14, 2022. In February, Mazin distributed a casting call for a boy aged 8–14 who is deaf, black, and proficient in American Sign Language or Black American Sign Language; Deaf West Theatre confirmed this was for the character of Sam, to appear in two episodes filmed in March and April. In June, Druckmann announced Baker and Ashley Johnson would star in the series; their character names were revealed in December. Lamar Johnson and Woodard's casting as Henry and Sam was announced in August, alongside the official announcement of Greene and Miles as Marlon and Florence. Lynskey's casting as Kathleen was announced alongside the teaser trailer in September, while Shepherd's casting was revealed in the first trailer in December. Wesley's role as Maria was announced on January 9.</p><p>According to Variety, casting for the second season was put on hold in May 2023 due to the Writers Guild of America strike; actors had been auditioning with scenes from The Last of Us Part II due to an absence of scripts.</p><h4>Writing</h4><p>A post-apocalyptic drama and thriller, the series was written by Mazin and Druckmann; Mazin wrote all episodes except the premiere and finale, which he co-wrote with Druckmann, and the seventh episode, written by Druckmann. Druckmann was convinced Mazin was the ideal creative partner for the series after witnessing his passion for the game's story; Druckmann referred to Mazin as the story's \"co-parent\". Mazin said the series may represent a paradigm shift for film and television adaptations of video games due to the strength of the narrative, noting \"it would only take 20 minutes on Google to realize The Last of Us is the Lawrence of Arabia of video game narratives\".</p><p>Druckmann felt the most important element of adapting the game was to \"keep the soul\", particularly the character relationships, whereas the gameplay and action sequences were of minimal importance. Mazin said the changes were \"designed to fill things out and expand, not to undo, but rather to enhance\". He said the series would avoid episodic storylines, such as random encounters not present in the original story. Content cut from the game was added to the show, including the story of Ellie's mother, Anna, which Mazin found \"gorgeous\" and demanded its inclusion in the series.: 3:39 Druckmann said some scripts borrow dialogue directly from the game, while others deviate; some of the game's action-heavy sequences were changed to focus on character drama at the encouragement of HBO. Druckmann said the series was taking the opposite approach to adaptation than the film Uncharted (2022); while Uncharted tells a new story with moments from the games to give \"an Uncharted flavor\", The Last of Us is a closer adaptation, allowing alterations such as changing character perspectives in a manner unachievable in an immersive game. Unlike creating the games, Druckmann felt he was able to \"unplug\" from the characters when writing the show due to the immersive nature of video games. The writers found the series an opportunity to delve into backstories of characters who the game otherwise ignored, wanting to better understand their motivations.</p><p>Druckmann was open to changing any aspects of the games but always wanted a strong reason, ensuring he and Mazin considered the impacts on events later in the narrative. The game's outbreak takes place in 2013, while its post-apocalyptic narrative occurs in 2033; this was changed to 2003 and 2023, as the writers felt the story taking place simultaneously with the show's release was more interesting and real, and did not fundamentally change the story. The writers added the outbreak's origins to the series to ground the narrative; following COVID-19, they recognized audiences are more knowledgeable about viral pandemics than they once were. Borrowing from an approach he had used in writing Chernobyl, Mazin began the series with a segment of a fictional 1960s talk show explaining the origins of a fungal infection, implying humanity knew of the potential risk for some time. For the show, the writers removed spores as the vector through which the infection is spread in the games, replacing it with tendrils that form a unified, interconnected network, inspired by the idea of mycelium. The writers felt the game's gas masks did not translate well into television and spores were not a realistic threat, and found replacing it with an interconnected network increased tension. Visually, the fungal infection was inspired by jellyfish stings after Žbanić sent an image to Mazin during preproduction. The writers avoided making \"a zombie show\", acknowledging the infected creatures were ultimately a vessel through which the characters are pressured to make interesting decisions and reveal their true selves.</p><p>A writers' room for the second season was established in Los Angeles by February 2023, and scripts were being written by April. Writing was impacted by the writers' strike in May; no scripts had been completed before the strike began, and neither Mazin nor Druckmann are working on the series while the strike is ongoing.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Supervising location manager Jason Nolan began preparation work for the series in January 2021, leading a 115-person team that found and transformed more than 180 locations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cast and crew quarantined for two weeks after entering Canada. Ksenia Sereda worked as cinematographer alongside Balagov, Mazin, Druckmann, and Johnson, Eben Bolter with Hoar and Webb, Christine A. Maier with Žbanić, and Nadim Carlsen with Abbasi. Sereda used an Alexa Mini with Cooke Optics S4 lenses; Bolter used the same as he felt it was effective for handheld shots while emulating 35 mm film. The series filmed for 200 days, with around 18–19 days per episode, amounting to 2–3 pages of script per day.</p><p>Filming began in Calgary, Alberta, on July 12, a week later than originally scheduled. It moved to High River and Fort Macleod throughout the month—replicating Austin, Texas, for the first episode—before moving to Calgary in August. Balagov's work completed production by August 30, and Hoar's on October 5. Around CA$372,000 was spent for a four-day shoot in Downtown Edmonton in October, including at Rice Howard Way and the Alberta Legislature Building. Filming took place in downtown Calgary and Beltline later in October. Druckmann's episode was completed by November 7. In November, production occurred in Canmore, Alberta, replicating Jackson, Wyoming, and at Mount Royal University and the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. Žbanić's episode completed production by December 9.</p><p>In January 2022, Northland Village Mall in northwest Calgary was decorated for production. Filming took place in Okotoks and Waterton Lakes National Park in February, and Airport Trail in northeast Calgary saw closures for three days in March. Webb's episodes entered production in March 2022 and continued until the end of principal photography in June. Calgary was used to replicate Kansas City, Missouri in March. Production continued in Calgary in April and May, including around the Calgary Courts Centre, Kensington, and Victoria Park. Reshoots for Texas scenes took place in Olds in late May and early June, and High River in June. Production concluded in the early hours of June 11, two days later than originally scheduled; Additional photography took place in Kansas City on October 4.</p><p>Filming for the second season is set to take place in British Columbia, including Vancouver. Production is planned to begin in early 2024.</p><h4>Music</h4><p>Santaolalla and David Fleming composed the score for the television series; the former wrote its opening theme. He said Latino viewers \"will recognize touches\" of his music, and drew on his experiences in film and television, having composed the themes and some tracks for Jane the Virgin (2014–2019) and Making a Murderer (2015–2018). He primarily recrafted his previous work instead of creating new music, focusing on elements he found interesting. Fleming's work was inspired by real-world sounds within a decayed civilization. A 66-track soundtrack album for the series was released digitally on February 27.</p><p>The first episode uses songs like \"Tomorrow\" by Avril Lavigne and \"White Flag\" by Dido to foreshadow Sarah's fate and Joel's character arc. Its final scene and credits feature the song \"Never Let Me Down Again\" by Depeche Mode, which Mazin chose due to its blend of upbeat sounds and dark lyrics;: 40:25 the song returned in the sixth episode, performed by Mazin's daughter Jessica, to demonstrate Ellie feeling let down by Joel. The third episode uses \"Long, Long Time\" by Linda Ronstadt, which exhibits themes of unfulfilled love and how time heals wounds, echoing Bill and Frank's relationship. Streams of the song increased significantly following the episode's broadcast; several outlets compared it to the 2022 resurgence of Kate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill\" after its use in the fourth season of Stranger Things.</p><p>The fourth episode's title references the lyrics of \"Alone and Forsaken\" by Hank Williams, which is used in the episode;: 1:01 it was previously used in the original game and one of its trailers, and a trailer for the television series. The seventh episode features \"All or None\" by Pearl Jam to represent Ellie's loneliness and uncomfortability,: 7:28 reuses Etta James's version of \"I Got You Babe\" from The Last of Us: Left Behind as its romantic lyrics hidden by joyous music mirrored the feelings of Ellie and Riley,: 56:28 and uses A-ha's \"Take On Me\" to reflect their feelings towards each other and illustrate Ellie's journey; a cover version of \"Take On Me\" was used in a trailer for the series, and Ellie performs the song in The Last of Us Part II.</p><h4>Design</h4><p>The production team included five art directors and hundreds of technicians. The game's art director, concept artists, and environment artists provided feedback on costumes and sets. Costume designer Cynthia Ann Summers found the series more difficult than outfit-focused media like fantasy or period pieces as the costumes had to be integral to the story without standing out. She ensured Joel's outfits demonstrated a lack of consideration, as he would place little thought into his appearance; Mazin demanded specific colours. Summers required around 30 duplicates of each outfit to account for elements like blood and dirt progression, stunt doubles, and reserves. The breakdown department, responsible for disfiguring outfits as required by the story, was led by Sage Lovett. At the request of Mazin, Summers and her team focused on minor details relevant to an apocalyptic setting, like shoelaces replacing belts. Pascal and Ramsey were happy to wear regular outfits as they had both worked on science-fiction and period pieces.</p><p>Production designer John Paino referenced the video game but focused on references used by Naughty Dog during development. He created an image collage which included a photograph of reassembled chairs, which Mazin considered the show's mandate: \"the built world is unbuilt and rebuilt\". Paino found several Canadian towns had similarities to American architecture, particularly Texas. He was unable to locate empty and abandoned buildings or location imitating Boston's brick-lined streets for the first two episodes, requiring manual transformation and constructions. Paino and his team constructed the Boston quarantine zone near Stampede Park over several months for the first episode, the town of Lincoln in around six to twelve weeks for the third, and the Kansas City cul-de-sac in nine weeks for the fifth.</p><p>Barrie and Sarah Gower, with whom Mazin had worked on Chernobyl, were engaged to create the prosthetics for the infected.: 0:31 Barrie Gower appreciated the series avoided \"stereotypical zombies—the pronounced cheekbones, sunken eyes, lots of blood and gore\". The production team created a large reference library for \"fuzz, slime mold, shelf mushrooms, button mushrooms, different textures and colors\". Mazin wanted the clickers to resemble the in-game design through prosthetics; he felt using visual effects would have lessened their impact.: 18:24 Their team found themselves continually referring to the original concept art from the game.: 0:44 For the approximately 70 actors portraying the infected mob in the fifth episode, 70 artists applied prosthetics to about 30 people in each three-hour shift. The 40 kilograms (88 lb) bloater suit was coated in an gel-like liquid during filming to appear wet and reflective. Paul Becker and Terry Notary choreographed the series. Notary wanted the creatures' movements to imitate each other, akin to schools of fish; for the fifth episode, he set up a boot camp to prepare the actors for the role.: 3:44 Misty Lee and Phillip Kovats, who had worked on the games, returned to voice the clickers for the series.</p><h4>Post-production</h4><p>The series was edited by Timothy A. Good and Emily Mendez; Mark Hartzell edited the second episode, and Cindy Mollo edited the eighth. After Mazin worked on Chernobyl, Good expressed interest in collaborating; the two had been friends for some time. A different editor was employed for The Last of Us but departed due to scheduling conflicts; Good joined the series after finishing work on the third season of The Umbrella Academy.: 18:17 Mendez worked on the third episode as Good's assistant editor; he showed her work to Mazin, and they agreed for Mendez to co-edit the seventh episode as it adapted Left Behind, her favorite part of the games. She continued as Good's co-editor for the fifth, sixth, and ninth episodes.: 27:35 Good chose not to play the game and let the dailies instruct his emotional instincts; Mendez and Mazin gave him details when necessary.: 34:01 Mendez was tasked with the temporary sound design, using her own library and sound effects from the game.: 49:19 Good used Santaolalla's soundtrack from the game as the temp score during editing and found it influenced his decisions.: 50:59</p><p>Sixteen visual effects teams worked on the series, supervised by Alex Wang. The season had over 3,000 visual effects shots; most episodes had around 250. The 650-person team at DNEG worked on 535 shots for the series over 18 months, primarily focusing on environmental effects, including the scenes set in Boston, Kansas City, Jackson, and Salt Lake City; field trips were conducted to gather resources, and the team regularly referenced the video games. The visual effects teams consulted with Naughty Dog's concept artists when creating the infected, and used timelapse videos of Cordyceps growth as animation references. All studios worked on the fifth episode's action sequence; the episode had around 350 to 400 visual effects shots. Wētā FX created the infected effects;: 41:05 50 to 70 creatures were digitally added to the horde. Design studio Elastic created the show's title sequence to demonstrate the \"unrelenting nature\" of the fungus; creative directors Andy Hall and Nadia Tzuo researched fungi to ensure an accurate depiction and movement. They pitched several ideas to Mazin and Druckmann before settling on the realistic depiction; Mazin enjoyed the idea of the fungus appearing beautiful despite its destructive nature.: 0:40</p><br/><h3>Release and promotion</h3><p>For The Last of Us Day on September 26, 2021, HBO shared the first image of Pascal and Ramsey in costume, followed by the first still from the series at Summer Game Fest on June 10, 2022. The first footage of the show was revealed in a HBO Max trailer during the premiere of House of the Dragon on August 21, featuring Pascal, Ramsey, Parker, and Offerman. The decision to develop The Last of Us Part I—a remake of the original game—was partly based on the potential to introduce show viewers to the games; it was released for PlayStation 5 in September 2022, and for Windows in March 2023. The first teaser trailer for the show was released for The Last of Us Day on September 26, 2022, featuring the first footage of Luna, Dandridge, Torv, and Reid, and confirming Lynskey's casting; the teaser, which used Hank William's \"Alone and Forsaken\", received over 17 million views in less than 24 hours across Twitter and YouTube.</p><p>While the series was originally indicated to begin airing in 2022, Bloys denied this in February 2022 and clarified it would begin in 2023, which was confirmed in the first teaser trailer. Following leaks from Sky and HBO Max, on November 2, 2022, HBO announced the series would premiere in the United States on January 15, 2023, and released the first official poster. The first season was broadcast on HBO in the United States, and is available to stream in 4K resolution on HBO Max; it was released on Binge in Australia, Crave in Canada, HBO Go and Now TV in Hong Kong, Disney+ Hotstar in India, U-NEXT in Japan, Neon in New Zealand, HBO Go in Southeast Asia and Taiwan, and Sky Group channels and Now in Germany and Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom and Ireland. The first episode received its red carpet world premiere in Westwood, Los Angeles on January 9, followed by theater screenings in Budapest and Sydney on January 11, and New York City on January 12. Behind-the-scenes videos, titled Inside the Episode, were released on HBO Max and YouTube following each episode's airing, and Naughty Dog released Building The Last of Us, featuring interviews with the cast and crew of the series and games.</p><p>A short clip of Joel and Ellie hiding from a Clicker was released on November 16 to tease the show's appearance at CCXP the following month. Posters for eleven characters were released on November 30. Dandridge, Druckmann, Luna, Mazin, Pascal, and Ramsey appeared on a panel at CCXP on December 3, where the first full trailer was released, revealing the first appearances of Baker, Ashley Johnson, and Shepherd. Baker, Ashley Johnson, Pascal, and Ramsey presented at The Game Awards 2022 on December 8. HBO announced Baker would host a companion podcast alongside the series, featuring Mazin and Druckmann. In January 2023, Pascal and Ramsey were featured on the cover of The Hollywood Reporter, while Pascal was on the cover of Wired. HBO released the first behind-the-scenes featurette on January 6, and several press outlets published interviews with cast and crew based on roundtable discussions from the previous month. Ramsey appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! alongside a clip from the series on January 9, and on The Late Late Show with James Corden on January 10. A season trailer was released after the airing of the first episode on January 15, and a two-hour trial of The Last of Us Part I was made available for PlayStation Plus Premium members.</p><p>Google released an Easter egg in late January, adding mushrooms to the screen when searching for The Last of Us or Cordyceps. On January 27, the first episode was released for free on HBO Max in the United States, and on Sky's YouTube channel in the United Kingdom. To promote the third episode, Bartlett appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on January 30, and Offerman on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on February 1. Pascal appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on February 2, and hosted Saturday Night Live on February 4; a viral skit from the latter featured Pascal portraying Mario in a \"prestige drama\" based on the Mario Kart series inspired by HBO's The Last of Us. Pascal appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers on February 15, The Graham Norton Show on February 24, and Hot Ones on March 9; the release of The Last of Us overlapped the promotion and release of The Mandalorian's third season.

The website's general consensus reads, \"Retaining the most addictive aspects of its beloved source material while digging deeper into the story, The Last of Us is bingeworthy TV that ranks among the all-time greatest video game adaptations.\" Metacritic calculated an average of 84 out of 100 based on 43 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Several reviewers considered it the best adaptation of a video game, with GameSpot's Mark Delaney saying it \"feels like the beginning of a new era\" for the genre.</p><p>Reviewers praised the differences from the original game's narrative implemented by Mazin and Druckmann, and some believed the scenes lifted directly from the game were among the weakest and led to issues with pacing. Variety's Daniel D'Addario felt the show relied too heavily on action sequences, while TechRadar's Axel Metz wanted more action. IGN's Simon Cardy wrote the series \"often shines brightest\" during its quietest moments. Critics overwhelmingly considered the third episode the season's best, and some named it among the greatest episodes of television overall. The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg felt it elevated the series to a new level, and Empire's John Nugent called it \"moving, surprisingly romantic, and one of the finest hours of television in recent memory\". Some critics found the first episode well-made but too familiar, and /Film's Valerie Ettenhofer considered it the season's weakest. RogerEbert.com's Brian Tallerico found the final two episodes rushed.</p><p>Several critics lauded the production design. Digital Spy's David Opie wrote \"every set feels like it was ripped straight out of the game\". Conversely, Slant Magazine's Pat Brown felt environments appeared too manicured and carefully placed. Inverse's Dais Johnston praised the use of lighting to highlight the humanity of both the characters and creatures, and called the cinematography \"something other video game adaptations could only dream of\". TV Guide's Keith Phipps called the series \"visually striking\", and IGN's Cardy wrote it \"is often a sight to behold\". Santaolalla's score received praise, with CNET's Sean Keane feeling it added \"a yearning of sadness to the narrative\".</p><p>The cast's performances received widespread acclaim, with critics singling out the chemistry between Pascal and Ramsey for praise. Evening Standard's Vicky Jessop said the two \"steal every scene they're in\", while Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall called them \"compulsively watchable and almost instantly endearing\". Empire's Nugent and /Film's Ettenhofer referred to Pascal's performance as the best of his career, citing his ability to portray nuance and rare vulnerability. TechRadar's Metz described him as the \"perfect real-world manifestation\" of Joel. Several critics found Ramsey gave the show's breakout performance for their balance of comedy and emotion, with Time's Judy Berman calling them \"the show's greatest asset\" and IGN's Cardy applauding them for \"making mark\" on Ellie, a character already considered iconic long before Ramsey's portrayal. Some critics considered the seventh episode Ramsey's strongest.</p><p>Guest performances throughout the season were highly praised. For the premiere, Rolling Stone's Sepinwall lauded Parker for \"holding the screen\" and establishing Sarah as likeable, and Push Square's Aaron Bayne wrote Luna flawlessly \"slips into the role\" with little screen time. Den of Geek's Bernard Boo found Torv in the second episode sophisticated and heartbreaking. Offerman and Bartlett's performances were described by Complex's William Goodman as \"career-best\" and by Inverse's Johnston as Emmy-worthy. Lynskey's performance in the fourth and fifth episodes was praised for juxtaposing humanity and viciousness. For the fifth episode, IGN's Cardy lauded Johnson's emotional performance in his final scene, and Total Film's Bradley Russell felt the naivety of Woodard's role intensified the narrative. Critics enjoyed Pascal and Luna's chemistry in the sixth episode, and Ramsey and Reid's in the seventh; Bleeding Cool's Tom Chang called the latter two \"award-worthy\", and Push Square's Bayne felt Reid effectively captured Riley's sense of \"youthful pride\". The A.V. Club's David Cote called Shepherd's performance \"masterful in its wry, understated charm\".</p><h4>Ratings</h4><p>The premiere episode had 4.7 million viewers in the United States on its first night of availability, including linear viewers and streams on HBO Max, making it the second-largest debut for HBO since 2010, behind House of the Dragon.

In January, The Last of Us Part I was the eighth-most-downloaded PlayStation 5 game in North America and tenth in Europe; on PlayStation 4, The Last of Us Part II was the seventh-most-downloaded in both regions, while The Last of Us Remastered was thirteenth in North America and fifteenth in Europe. In February, Part I rose to sixth in North America and seventh in Europe, Remastered to ninth and seventh, respectively, in Part II to first in both regions. In the United Kingdom, in the week after the premiere, Remastered sales increased by 337 percent over the previous week and The Last of Us Part I by 305 percent, with both reentering the charts as a result. The following week, Part I saw another 32 percent increase at retail, and Remastered 27 percent. For the month, Part II sales increased 317 percent, and Remastered 285 percent. In the United States, Part I reentered the January charts at 11th, climbing 25 positions from the previous month.</p><h4>Awards and nominations</h4><p>The Last of Us was nominated for six awards at the 2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards, and won three: Best Show, Best Duo for Pascal and Ramsey, and Best Hero for Pascal. In April 2023, HBO confirmed Sereda and Bolter would submit the first and third episodes, respectively, for Outstanding Cinematography for a Series (One Hour) at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards. Ramsey, who identifies as non-binary, considered withdrawing from Emmy consideration due to the lack of non-gendered categories, following Liv Hewson's withdrawal for their performance in Yellowjackets; after discussing alternatives with Mazin, Ramsey decided to contend for Lead Actress, not wanting the limited language to prevent the celebration of non-binary performers.</p><br/>"

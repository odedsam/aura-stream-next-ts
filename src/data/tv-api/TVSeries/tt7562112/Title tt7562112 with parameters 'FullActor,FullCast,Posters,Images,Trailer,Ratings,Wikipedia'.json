Murphy explained this decision saying, \"The thing that struck me in talking to so many of them, was how much they've struggled, how under attack they feel, how many of them find it difficult getting healthcare, and finding jobs. I just decided I need to do more than just making a show for this community. I want to reach out and help this community.\" On July 12, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season which premiered on June 11, 2019.

Murphy directed the series' first two episodes and Mock directed the sixth, thus making her the first transgender woman of color to write and direct any episode of television. On March 14, 2020, production on the third season was suspended due to the COVID-19 health crisis. The third and final season's filming wrapped on March 20, 2021.\r\nRelease\r\nMarketing\r\nOn April 12, 2018, FX released the first teaser trailer for the series. It was also announced that the series was set to premiere on June 3, 2018. On May 3, 2018, the first official trailer was released.\r\nPremiere\r\nOn May 17, 2018, the series held its world premiere at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan. On July 23, 2018, Dyllón Burnside emceed a benefit concert, duetting with co-stars Billy Porter and Ryan Jamaal Swain to celebrate the season one finale, and raise money for GLSEN. During the event, a conversation was held between Burnside and former Vibe editor-in-chief Emil Wilbekin, where Burnside discussed his coming out story and spoke about the importance of safe spaces for LGBTQ people. Later on in the evening, Porter sang from his latest album and Michaela Jaé Rodriguez sang \"Waving Through a Window\" from Dear Evan Hansen.\r\nIn March 2019, the series was part of the Paley Center for Media's annual Paleyfest LA at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California.\r\nPose premiered in the United Kingdom on March 21, 2019, on BBC Two. Season 2 premiered on October 26, 2019, and Season 3 on August 8, 2021. All full series made available on BBC iPlayer straight after each series' premiere.\r\nInfluences\r\nWhile a work of creative fiction, the series is \"heavily inspired by\" Jennie Livingston's 1990 documentary, Paris Is Burning. Livingston also served as a consulting producer on the show. Several of the houses and characters were based on, or named after, real people, and several people featured in the documentary also made cameos in the series, such as Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza, an icon of the voguing scene, who plays a judge throughout the first series, and Sol Pendavis Williams, of the House of Pendavis. Creators and producers of the series, Murphy, Canals, and writer/producer Janet Mock all considered Paris Is Burning \"a text that helped inform not only the show, but also their identities when they first saw it.\"\r\nPose also expands on one of Paris Is Burning's subtler themes. At various points in the film, Livingston contrasts the drag performers with ordinary, affluent New Yorkers, walking down busy Manhattan sidewalks. It's often hard to tell which of these two groups is more \"real\", which of them are fashion models or Wall Street power players and which are simply costumed as such. Pose elaborates on those subtle distinctions with a subplot involving Stan (Evan Peters), a rising star in the Trump organization with an obnoxious boss (James Van Der Beek), a pretty wife (Kate Mara), and a secret relationship with Angel (Indya Moore), a trans woman. The show aims to capture some of the diversity of New York in the '80s, while also emphasizing the idea that, whether rich or poor, everyone in the city is pretending, in one way or another.\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nSeason 1\r\nOn the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 96% approval rating with an average rating of 8.3/10 based on 84 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Charged with energy, poise, and confidence, Pose pirouettes between artistic opulence and deliciously soapy drama to create a fresh new addition to Ryan Murphy's lexicon.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the first season a score of 75 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nIn a positive review, Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson was effusive, describing the series as \"an engaging portrait of dark days met with merriment. Pain and perseverance are sewn together to create something humble yet fabulous—and, it should be shouted over all the show's loud and glorious clamor, very much long overdue.\" In a similarly favorable critique, Vulture's Matt Zoller Seitz praised the series' ambition, aesthetic, and spotlight on minorities saying, \"it shows American audiences a world that has never been visualized on television at this length and at such an obviously grand budget level. The camera swings and swoops, glides and tumbles as in a Scorsese epic like Gangs of New York; in both the outdoor street scenes and indoor crowd scenes, it's obvious that FX has spared no expense to get the clothes, the cars, the streets, the business signs, and even the distinctive yellow-brown glow of streetlights correct.\" In a more mixed assessment, Newsday's gave the series two-and-a-half stars out of four and described it far less approvingly saying, \"good intentions don't always lead to good TV, and a couple episodes in, that appears to be the case with Pose. This certainly isn't bad TV—Murphy isn't about to leave his longtime home with a turkey—but it's often bland TV, and oddly enough, stock TV.\" In a negative evaluation, Slate's Willa Paskin was outright dismissive saying, \"It's a TV show from one of the most canny creators working today, yet as a viewing experience it can feel like an object lesson.\" She continued on specifically criticizing the show's character development saying, \"So many of the people on Pose are strong women, trans paragons, and this comes at the expense of them being recognizably flawed human beings.\"\r\nSeason 2\r\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds a 98% approval rating with an average rating of 8.40/10 based on 41 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A delightful, delicate dance of light and dark, Pose's second season achieves a striking balance between the grittiness of reality and the glamour of the runway and shines even brighter.\" On Metacritic, season 2 holds a score of 79 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\r\nSeason 3\r\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the third season holds a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 7.70/10 based on 29 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though it's entirely too short, Pose's final season is a joyously entertaining celebration of life that is not to be missed.\" On Metacritic, season 3 holds a score of 76 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\r\nRatings\r\nSeason 1\r\nSeason 2\r\nSeason 3\r\nAccolades",

Murphy explained this decision saying, \"The thing that struck me in talking to so many of them, was how much they've struggled, how under attack they feel, how many of them find it difficult getting healthcare, and finding jobs. I just decided I need to do more than just making a show for this community. I want to reach out and help this community.\" On July 12, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season which premiered on June 11, 2019.

The series' production team claimed that they had assembled the largest transgender cast ever for a scripted series. The series was expected to include over 50 transgender characters total. On October 26, 2017, it was announced that Evan Peters, Kate Mara, James Van Der Beek, and Tatiana Maslany had also joined the main cast.</p><p>On December 27, 2017, it was reported that Maslany had exited the series following the redevelopment of her part into that of a 50-year-old African-American woman.

Season 2 premiered on October 26, 2019, and Season 3 on August 8, 2021. All full series made available on BBC iPlayer straight after each series' premiere.</p><br/><h3>Influences</h3><p>While a work of creative fiction, the series is \"heavily inspired by\" Jennie Livingston's 1990 documentary, Paris Is Burning. Livingston also served as a consulting producer on the show. Several of the houses and characters were based on, or named after, real people, and several people featured in the documentary also made cameos in the series, such as Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza, an icon of the voguing scene, who plays a judge throughout the first series, and Sol Pendavis Williams, of the House of Pendavis. Creators and producers of the series, Murphy, Canals, and writer/producer Janet Mock all considered Paris Is Burning \"a text that helped inform not only the show, but also their identities when they first saw it.\"</p><blockquote>Pose also expands on one of Paris Is Burning's subtler themes. At various points in the film, Livingston contrasts the drag performers with ordinary, affluent New Yorkers, walking down busy Manhattan sidewalks. It's often hard to tell which of these two groups is more \"real\", which of them are fashion models or Wall Street power players and which are simply costumed as such. Pose elaborates on those subtle distinctions with a subplot involving Stan (Evan Peters), a rising star in the Trump organization with an obnoxious boss (James Van Der Beek), a pretty wife (Kate Mara), and a secret relationship with Angel (Indya Moore), a trans woman. The show aims to capture some of the diversity of New York in the '80s, while also emphasizing the idea that, whether rich or poor, everyone in the city is pretending, in one way or another.</blockquote><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Critical response</h4><h4>Season 1</h4><p>On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 96% approval rating with an average rating of 8.3/10 based on 84 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Charged with energy, poise, and confidence, Pose pirouettes between artistic opulence and deliciously soapy drama to create a fresh new addition to Ryan Murphy's lexicon.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the first season a score of 75 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".</p><p>In a positive review, Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson was effusive, describing the series as \"an engaging portrait of dark days met with merriment. Pain and perseverance are sewn together to create something humble yet fabulous—and, it should be shouted over all the show's loud and glorious clamor, very much long overdue.\" In a similarly favorable critique, Vulture's Matt Zoller Seitz praised the series' ambition, aesthetic, and spotlight on minorities saying, \"it shows American audiences a world that has never been visualized on television at this length and at such an obviously grand budget level. The camera swings and swoops, glides and tumbles as in a Scorsese epic like Gangs of New York; in both the outdoor street scenes and indoor crowd scenes, it's obvious that FX has spared no expense to get the clothes, the cars, the streets, the business signs, and even the distinctive yellow-brown glow of streetlights correct.\" In a more mixed assessment, Newsday's gave the series two-and-a-half stars out of four and described it far less approvingly saying, \"good intentions don't always lead to good TV, and a couple episodes in, that appears to be the case with Pose. This certainly isn't bad TV—Murphy isn't about to leave his longtime home with a turkey—but it's often bland TV, and oddly enough, stock TV.\" In a negative evaluation, Slate's Willa Paskin was outright dismissive saying, \"It's a TV show from one of the most canny creators working today, yet as a viewing experience it can feel like an object lesson.\" She continued on specifically criticizing the show's character development saying, \"So many of the people on Pose are strong women, trans paragons, and this comes at the expense of them being recognizably flawed human beings.\"</p><h4>Season 2</h4><p>On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds a 98% approval rating with an average rating of 8.40/10 based on 41 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A delightful, delicate dance of light and dark, Pose's second season achieves a striking balance between the grittiness of reality and the glamour of the runway and shines even brighter.\" On Metacritic, season 2 holds a score of 79 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"</p><h4>Season 3</h4><p>On Rotten Tomatoes, the third season holds a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 7.70/10 based on 29 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though it's entirely too short, Pose's final season is a joyously entertaining celebration of life that is not to be missed.\" On Metacritic, season 3 holds a score of 76 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"</p><h4>Ratings</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><caption><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1152813436\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Viewership and ratings per season of <i>Pose</i></span></caption><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\">Season</th><th scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\">Timeslot (<span>ET</span>)</th><th scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\">Episodes</th><th scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\">First aired</th><th scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\">Last aired</th><th scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"><abbr title=\"Average\">Avg.</abbr> viewers<br>(millions)</th><th scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\">18–49<br>rank</th><th scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"><abbr title=\"Average\">Avg.</abbr> 18–49<br>rating</th></tr><tr><th scope=\"col\">Date</th><th scope=\"col\">Viewers<br>(millions)</th><th scope=\"col\">Date</th><th scope=\"col\">Viewers<br>(millions)</th></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span>1</span></th><td rowspan=\"1\">Sunday 9:00 pm</td><td>8</td><td>June 3, 2018</td><td>0.688</td><td>July 22, 2018</td><td>0.781</td><td rowspan=\"1\">0.645</td><td rowspan=\"1\"><small><span style=\"color: #2C2C2C\">TBD</span></small></td><td rowspan=\"1\">0.25</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span>2</span></th><td rowspan=\"1\">Tuesday 10:00 pm</td><td>10</td><td>June 11, 2019</td><td>0.672</td><td>August 20, 2019</td><td>0.536</td><td rowspan=\"1\">0.541</td><td rowspan=\"1\"><small><span style=\"color: #2C2C2C\">TBD</span></small></td><td rowspan=\"1\">0.19</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span>3</span></th><td rowspan=\"1\">Sunday 10:00 pm</td><td>8</td><td>May 2, 2021</td><td>0.498</td><td>June 6, 2021</td><td>0.485</td><td rowspan=\"1\"><small><span style=\"color: #2C2C2C\">TBD</span></small></td><td rowspan=\"1\"><small><span style=\"color: #2C2C2C\">TBD</span></small></td><td rowspan=\"1\"><small><span style=\"color: #2C2C2C\">TBD</span></small></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"mbox-text\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><div class=\"mbox-text-span\">Graphs are temporarily unavailable due to technical issues.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left:.8em;padding-right:.8em\">Season</th><th colspan=\"10\" style=\"padding-left:.8em;padding-right:.8em\">Episode number</th><th scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left:.8em;padding-right:.8em\">Average</th></tr><tr><th scope=\"col\">1</th><th scope=\"col\">2</th><th scope=\"col\">3</th><th scope=\"col\">4</th><th scope=\"col\">5</th><th scope=\"col\">6</th><th scope=\"col\">7</th><th scope=\"col\">8</th><th scope=\"col\">9</th><th scope=\"col\">10</th></tr><tr><th style=\"background-color:#EFAFD8;width:10px\"></th><th scope=\"row\">1</th><td style=\"width:35px\">688</td><td style=\"width:35px\">548</td><td style=\"width:35px\">561</td><td style=\"width:35px\">719</td><td style=\"width:35px\">582</td><td style=\"width:35px\">594</td><td style=\"width:35px\">689</td><td style=\"width:35px\">781</td><td data-sort-value=\"\" class=\"table-na\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ececec;

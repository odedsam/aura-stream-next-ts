What is really nice about the series ,except the fact that all the actors in the series are simply amazing, is that we are shown (although I'm sure it's only fragile) all the experiences and difficulties the characters go through. Although it is a matter of years past, you can see that our world has progressed, but not much in its attitude towards the different. Maybe if all people are exposed to this series, then maybe something will change, because as the series says, the world does not change on its own, the people are the ones who change it."

      "content": "I remember this time so clearly. The clubs, the slow - then rapid - rise of AIDS, the combination of having the freedom of clubs to go for the LGBT community combined with friends either being terrified they had AIDS - or their despair when they found out they did. Finally, fighting back: ACT UP, drug imports from foreign countries, the AIDS quilt, protest marches.This show should be watched by every LGBT person who did not live through the AIDS epidemic before the triple cocktail was invented and people could actually survive long-term once they knew they had HIV/AIDS. The world for about 15 years was a terrifying place for the community, and POC were so disproportionately hit, it was horrifying - because the few drugs/treatments available were extremely expensive, and they had two forms of discrimination working against them. This was true even after the triple cocktail was first available.The one good thing that came out of it was that it brought lesbians/bi women, gay men and trans people together for a common cause: that we not be considered disposable."

This show operates smoothly at several different levels and tackles the hard stuff. At its heart is the issue of family-it's enduring position as safe harbor & moral compass, and the human tendency to create families of our own to uphold and sustain us when the traditional model has failed."

Serving face, looks ans subjects that actually matter in our society. I hope it grows, pushing the actors forward to get better and better.

The culture may be foreign to me, but the simple, human dignity and pain make this show universal and timeless. Not to mention I've rarely seen an ensemble of more gifted actors. Pose is a sparkling, heart-breaking, terribly human, beautifully tragic gem. Well done and thank you for creating it."

Yet as much as I love it, I feel half the episodes are like watching re-runs of Jem and the holograms. There's goodies and baddies for every episode, push down your throat morality lessons, and unrealistic poverty living standards. The main lesson I've learnt is that as long as your beautiful and wear amazing clothes you'll life will be fabulous. Forget hardship, just put on a lipstick, spend all your money on outfits and the gym and you'll be fine. The shows premise is amazing, the actors are great and the background stories for the main characters need telling. Yet we need to be able tell these stories in a realistic way so they can be properly understood, so that the audience can fully explore and comprehend the real drama of people's Lives. I feel Pose takes important issues and works to raise awareness but does so with so much millennial style filtering that the real meaning is lost amongst all the gloss and glitter."

      "content": "All of the scenes are so colorful and full of life with style and dont forget culture. Speaking of color and the lead in direction, I must be watching a Ryan Murphy production. His style has always been one of my favorite. For e.g. the cinmatography from The normal Heart and The people Vs OJ to name two fright off my head. The music more than everything is like a character in this series itself, playing the mid 80s music, especially whenever it was capturing the nostalgia. This shows isnt what it says to be at first. In fact, I watched the first 5 minutes intrigued and then it turned into something different. Watch the whole first episode before deciding on whether you like it or not. You will find after two episodes that the characters go through hard times through the character development that really feel like the shows main strength. Its gritty and raw. The first scene with the son being confronted by his dad was showing the exact range this series has. Five minutes before that the characters in the present were absolutely playing different roles. The switch back to time scene was jarring but true to how being a homosexual was and sadly is still is for those. I'm appalled by the great reviews left and not supported by this community. It leaves me wondering why people would find their reviews mir helpful. READ ALL THE POSTIVE REVIEWS here too, I suggest bc tbey I'm usually reluctant about reviews but this show is put together by the masterful Rynan Murphy, or the guy Netflix just paid 300 million for! If you want to lose yourself and escape to this world of bright colors and incredible music and great directing, though some of the acting may not be top tier all the time. It. Will. Still be refreshing and feel like a breath of fresh air when you've watched what episodes theres to offer (2 at the point of this review). Do conineue it will be so much and original and unique imo!!!"

      "content": "Just finished watching Pose on my DVR and to say I was blown away was an understatement. The great thing about this show is the characters. They have focused heavily on character development and the \"show, don't tell\" aspect of the community and their lives. The opening, when they hid in the museum hooked me. Near the end when the head of the house declared, \"I'm his mother!\" I knew I'd be watching this series. The characters are interesting, the story is compelling, and the overall tone is about people making the most of their lives. The fact that their gay, or different, while central to the show, transcends the show, so what you're left with is a quality piece of television. This is definitely for adults as an F-bomb was dropped but unless you were really looking for it, it was almost overlooked. Even the minor characters are relevant; love the man on the mic at the ball! I'll continue to watch this. My only downside, which is why I gave it an 8 instead of something higher has to do with some of the acting that is fabulous but stiff. Elektra, the head of House Abundance, makes me think of the \"William Shatner School of Acting\" sometimes. Her deliveries are over-the-top but also sound like she's reading her lines. She needs to loosen up a bit more. It seems her character is formal, almost too formal, but she's not selling it. I hope as time goes on, she'll get better. Other times, the dancing seemed to stiff and not believable. The dance-off felt like \"we must lose this because, you know, drama!\" as opposed to a natural lose.Overall, a great show. As I said, I'll be watching this."

The music, dress, terms and struggle was just as real then as it is today. To be accepted, sometimes you have to be fearless. This takes place \"back in the day\" when it was thought that only gay men got hiv, all males who danced ballet were considered gay or curious. Today, folks are quick to think things have always been they way they are now- this show brilliantly shows you that it was a clear struggle to get where we are today its a constant struggle.

I'm hoping that Ryan Murphy doesn't create a trajectory similar to what we observed with \"Glee\" and am comforted that he stayed away from a \"Paris Is Burning\" musical (thus far) as the film itself caused controversy and uproar related to matters of appropriation. I hope that the Pose writers listen to community members on set and keep it real, though many are too young to have experienced, first hand, the events they portray. Please continue to seek out and promote talent in the form of community members who were in the ballroom scene and solicit their input! HIV ravaged the community during this time period and those seeking the comfort of others living the same experience, sharing the same space, were challenged in many ways. It's difficult to invest in relationships that may be fleeting due to a deadly illness. For those critiquing the acting, it's unfortunate you're not celebrating the use of transgender talent within a community that exists largely in the shadows and is marginalized in our narrow-minded society. For those making societal degradation comments, there are lots of other channels. TV Land may be more your speed.All that said, I'm loving what I see so far! Thank you for taking this on."

Pose is a breakthrough for Trans Gender actors in the fact that all the main transgender characters are actually played by trans actors. The series has a heart and is very emotional at times when depicting the struggle the Gay Community went through during the AIDS plague that wiped out a generation of gifted and wonderful people. It reminds us of the complacency and neglect the Reagan Administration demonstrated during the crises by denying medication and support to the homeless and sick in America. The glamour costumes and music are fantastic and the different houses competing for the coveted trophies are a part of New York culture I didn't know much about . The Transgender \"House Mothers\" took in so many desperate homeless young GLBT men and women who were given a chance of acceptance and creativity in a world that shunned and rejected their natures."

True ballroom culture was mostly male drag queens and gay men, not transwomen.At some points that is clear because it doesn't make sense. For example at some points in ball competitions there will be 'realness checks' to see how well some of the performers pass as Women.Well, when they depict this in the show the actors are transwomen who've been on hormones and have implants. Of course they 'pass' and furthermore we're told transwomen are women so how are women passing as women?This would of been better if it was about early Trans culture in the 80s instead of centering it in ballroom culture.It can still be entertaining. You get plenty of drama, queer culture, 80s/90s vibes, shining moments and nice aesthetics.Sometimes there are slumps, poor acting, farfetched storylines, glaring potholes and straight up non-sense.I would suggest watching it but don't expect too much."

      "title": "Inspiration for this show",
      "content": "In 1990 I saw the documentary \"Paris is Burning\" covering this same scene, Find yourself a cd somewhere pr watch it on You Tube and see the real thing. Madonna went to the balls and incorporated backup dancers voguing to material from these balls. It gave her career another boost, Many of the young people lead marginal existences living on dreams. One of the most petite fragile people was found beaten to death soon after with no biological family to claim her body. Her house saved her body being dumped in potter's field.I'll revise my score if this show starts getting more realistic about how it actually was."

      "content": "This film is the epitome of the real life of New York Life. Aside from the shopping and hustle and Bustle of the Big Apple's life, this film provides such an honest, realistic, and creative film of what the epitome of the New York Life, Dream, and Struggles.Obviously not all people in the Big Apple struggle with the realities of the characters in this film, but the concept is spot on. To the extent where I believe 100% of New Yorkers would understand and relate if they could see the obvious reality of what this film capitalizes on \"Dog eat Dog\" and \"the city of slaved dreams and staged roles\"."

      "question": "If the kids are in the ages between 6 and 7 years old isn't that a little weird that they choose Nicole Kidman and Laura dern to play the role of a 6 years old mother? I mean till what age you can still get pregnant?",
      "answer": "It is obvious they are 'acting' the part. A woman can still get pregnant into her late thirties and early forties, some women have babies in their fifties. Both woman look great for their ages and I have no problem believing they have young children."

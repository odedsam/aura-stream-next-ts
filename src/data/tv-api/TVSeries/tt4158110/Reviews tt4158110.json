      "title": "The Most Well Thought Out and Unpredictable Show of All Time.",
      "content": "This show is genuinely perfect on so many levels. The first season although very reminiscent of Fight Club is still done in such a unique way with unrivalled directing, music and portrayals of genuinely interesting and gripping characters that it sets itself apart from the crowd. Season 2 although seemingly messy and confusing on the surface unravels episode by episode and becomes a much deeper delve into the mindset of Elliot and his alter ego Mr Robot as well as an important part of the overall puzzle presented by the show. Season 3 was at the time of broadcasting my favourite season of television with consistently brilliant instalments every week, including but not limited to Kill Process, Runtime Error, Shutdown and Don't Delete Me. The bold steps taken by season 3 marked a point of no return where they had to go hard or go home with their final season and after a 2 year wait we got what I believe to be the greatest season of television in the history of the media and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Every episode of season 4 is an absolute masterpiece in all respective departments. Mac Quayle delivers another incredible expansion to the score which is one of the staples of Mr Robot and is almost single handedly responsible for its gripping atmosphere, Sam Esmail brings his A game firing on all cylinders in directing and writing giving us shocking and satisfying answers to the questions that need answering and wonderfully frustrating ambiguity to the ones that didn't and the cast are all award worthy, from Rami Malek to Christian Slater, Carly Chaikin to BD Wong, even Joey Bada$$ and Elliot Villar! they all deserve the highest possible praise for their work on this show that they have helped bring to life. Not only is Mr Robot a consistently intriguing and gripping show but it also sticks the landing making its finale its best episode which after Proxy Authentication Required, Kill Process, eXit and Conflict is no small feat. Thank you to all that helped piece together this incredible puzzle and thank YOU for reading this review. I'm going to give Mr Robot a 10/10. Goodbye, friend."

      "title": "Now that it's over, I am confident in giving it a 10.",
      "content": "Even if you don't like it, Mr. Robot is undeniably a very unique show with lots of great ideas. It's biggest crime to this day is how much it stole from Fight Club, which is now more or less forgiven by everyone.The show is very stylish, it's unique camera angles, I love hoe they play with focus, and zooms. There are a lot of very great little montages, or parts where there is a lot of quick editing. The show's intro alone is unique enough to make people excited for the episode. So the editing is really on point inthe first 3 seasons, but in the 4th season it slows the hell down, and there is an abundance of really long takes, that are really impressive. Some locations in and of themselves are beautiful, and the CG is mostly well done, although it is not a prominent thing in the series, it's just a tool they use to make long takes easier to pull off, and it's pretty seamless, with the exception of a scene from 402 Payment Required.The whole show and the world of it is full of details. The title of every episode is very closely tied to the story and the fact that they are hackers in the show itself. There are actual websites from the world of the show, reddit pages from 2015 (the year the show is in), and so on.The descriptions for each episode on Amazon Prime are really funny too.The story and the motivations of characters always change and the show is many things at once, but it's always about the main protagonists's internal, personal emotional journey, it's the central focus of the show. He is a really likable character.Mental illness, hacking, and economics are all pretty accurately and realistically predicted in the show, that make the world all the more interesting.The overall plot is just there so that the characters always have something to do, but the characters are the important and interesting part. All the characters are either lonely, depressed, anxious, or lost, and the show explores them very deeply. All of them are different so it makes for very fascinating scenes.I don't want to say too much, but watch the first few episodes. If you like Elliot and who he is, than continue with it, and always watch it like it's his show, because it is. It is about him.Another advice: Watch Season 2 in a short period of time. Lot of people got bored because there is very little progression in a huge amount of time, and for some, it is frustrating. Still, keep watching because Season 3 and 4 are universally accepted as magnificent seasons of television.Thank you Sam Esmail! You are amazing."

      "title": "a modern masterwork",
      "content": "In my spoiler-free summary of this show, I'm here to express what this show has done to change everything about how I think of serial drama television. I will probably come back to do a follow-up review once the show is finally over because I'm sure this won't do Mr. Robot justice while the main story is still yet to be fully unveiled.From the performances, the ever-so-slowly unraveling global conspiracy in the story/plot, the characters, the directing, the writing, the cinematography, the set design, costume design, editing, and lighting (and something else I'm sure I must be forgetting), everything is top-notch for me.What seems to turn people off of this show is how it radically changes in its second season, and even partially through its first season. I guess I can understand this, Mr. Robot isn't a show for everyone. But I appreciate this because I personally felt that Mr. Robot came into its own when it started to get super abstract and philosophical and character-focused later in season 2. That's where I feel like it really became \"Mr. Robot\" to me. No matter what, the plot moves nowhere before the characters are thoroughly explored. Those are the priorities of the show. The complex conspiracy in the main plot is often cast aside for character study and emotional development because the characters are the most important part of the story. This makes it so that once the full truth behind the conspiracy is ready to be revealed, it'll feel so much more rewarding getting to experience it with all of the characters that have had plenty of time to be thoroughly emotionally explored. Because, in the end, why care about the people in the world of the show if that aspect is being cut short for less impactful story arcs and reveals?Overall, I'm so happy I discovered this show and there is absolutely nothing like it. It is the most one-of-a-kind serial drama series ever made, truly, and undoubtedly the best television drama of the 2010s in my eyes. And that makes Mr. Robot pretty special to me.:)"

      "content": "WARNING: *MILD SPOILERS*I, like many people, didn't know about Mr. Robot until a year ago which is when I decided to give it a watch and ever since then I've been trying to get more people to watch this spectacular show.Mr. Robot follows Elliot Alderson, a man who is a cyber security engineer by day and a hacker by night. One day, a man named Mr. Robot recruits him into his underground hacking group to destroy E Corp, the largest conglomerate in the world.It's been a while since I've finished this show and I'm still thinking about it to this day. This is one of my favourite shows of all time. From the opening scene of the first episode alone I knew I was in for something special. This is Sam Esmail's show and he's directed majority of the episodes. There's a particular style Esmail uses throughout that makes Mr. Robot stand out. The range of camera angles, the way scenes are framed and the way every scene is lit makes this show unique and beautiful to look at. I don't think there is a single weak episode in this series. This show's depiction of hacking looks incredibly realistic. The way it's edited and shot make it so intense and entertaining to watch. On top of that we have Mac Quayle's phenomenal score. Whilst I admit it sounds reminiscent of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's work, it fits well with the tone of the show and I love listening to it.Season 1 is a great introduction into the eerie world of Mr. Robot and its characters. There's a lot we learn about every single character which leads to an epic season finale. It's filled with so many brilliant sequences that's edited marvellously. The dialogues are fantastic especially Elliot's narration that takes us into his mind and help us see the world through his eyes. Season 2 takes a more sombre turn and focuses primarily on developing the characters. It's my least favourite season out of the four but it introduces interesting characters and threats that build up the stakes for the upcoming seasons. Season 3 is absolutely insane. This season amps up the stakes further and gets to a point where the show becomes cinematic rather than just a TV show. Then we have Season 4, a season I believe breaks boundaries and has one of the best endings to a show ever!I also love how experimental Sam Esmail gets with this show. I always looked forward to the opening title sequence because of how different it feels each time. There's one that acts like a sitcom and one in the style of The Shining. It's very creative and prevents the show from becoming repetitive. Some episodes stand out on a filmmaking and writing perspective. There's one that looks like it's been shot in one take, one without any dialogue and one that takes place in a single location. It's these episodes in particular that elevate Mr. Robot's quality and presentation. Aside from the presentation, this show tackles many themes that are relevant. Its commentary on society, politics and mental illness above all makes Mr. Robot so thought-provoking and interesting. It handles these topics with so much care and the planning Sam Esmail and his team did to convey this through the story and characters is nothing short of astounding.One of the best aspects is the acting. Rami Malek is absolutely stellar throughout. He embodies Elliot and adds a lot of depth to the character through his expressions especially through his eyes that give a tired look to Elliot. It's a difficult character to play but Malek succeeds in every way. It's so good to see Christian Slater after a long time and he is also fantastic as Mr. Robot. Carly Chaikin and Portia Doubleday do an excellent job as Darlene and Angela. Martin WallstrÃ¶m as Tyrell Wellick is amazing. It amazes me how well he's able to play such a strange and crazy character. Michael Cristofer is brilliant as Phillip Price. I love his voice which makes him a commanding presence in each scene he's in. BD Wong as Whiterose is incredible. This is another role that's hard to play but Wong is captivating all the way through. Grace Gummer is also very good here and I loved the development given to her role.Despite all the praise I'm giving, this shows still has flaws. The twist at the end of Season 1 where we find out Elliot and Mr. Robot is the same person completely rips off Fight Club and at times Angela's storyline isn't as interesting as the rest of characters'.Aside from the minor issues I have, Mr. Robot will be an experience I'll never forget. The amount of thought, care and planning that went into the show amazes me. Every single performance is excellent and Sam Esmail is a very talented filmmaker who hopefully continues creating exciting films or shows like this in the future."

This is by far one of the most well excecuted series in its decade, this isn't Lost where every unexplainabe thing just fades in a distance. This also isn't Twin Peaks where the bizarre moments will never be explained but encouraged.The violence gets real intensive from season 3 onwards, it gives me the same intense feeling I got when watching Breaking Bad. Most importantly is how the series ends. The last seven episodes gives you a grand finale of absolute mind boggling intensity that has you shaking at the edge of your seat. Everything unfolds. The best is once you think its the end, and they cannot possibly have 2 or 3 episodes left, it blows your mind, makes you cry and really understand the world of Elliott.How a series ends has always been important to me, thats why I loved Six feet Under and Battlestar Galactica. But Mr Robot is one of the best examples of how you end a series!! The writers of the last season of Game of Thrones should have taken notes. Truly a masterpiece! It stands unique on its own."

Also, since the beginning, it became clear to me that Christian Slater could have played with more intensity, craziness and gutsy performance. He was too slow and dull compared to Rami Malek and that ruined a little and negatively impacted on their onscreen interactions IMO.You want to feel real presence tainted with hypnotic intensity, watch Stephanie Corneliussen's performance in the show and you will understand thoroughly what I mean.A rare, sort of underrated gem in the world of series and IMO, second to 'Dark' in terms of complexity.Screenplay/story: 9.9Development: 9.9Realism: 9.5Entertainment: 9.5Acting: 9.9Filming/cinematography: 9.5Special effects: 9Music/score: 9.5Depth: 9.8Logic: 9Flow: 9.5Suspense/thrill: 9.4Ending/closure: 9"

The amount of amazing episodes Sam has created is insane and it makes me wonder why this show has only an 8.5, it deserves at least an 8.8 or higher.With all that out of the way, here are my ratings for each season.Season 1.0 - 9.5 amazing start to a series, especially the first episode, a few episodes later it gets less interesting, but after seeing episode 6, 8, and 9, I knew I was in for something special.Season 2.0 - 8.0 a bit of a weak season tbh, it had some really good moments, especially near the end, but at the end of the day, it's probably the worst season of the show. But it's definitely not badSeason 3.0 - 9.0 significant upgrade from season 2, featuring some really good episodes such as, \"runtime error\", \"kill process\", \"don't delete me\" and \"shutdown-r\"Season 4.0 - 10.0 words can't describe how amazing this season was. From having the greatest opener episode in the show to an incredibly sad series finale, this season will probably be the most memorable other than season 1. Especially with episodes such as \"407 Proxy Authentication Required\", \"405 method not allowed\", \"eXit\", \"Whoami\", and of course, \"hello, Elliot\"bravo Sam, bravo."

      "content": "Mr. Robot Staring Rami Malek, Christian Slater, and Portia Doubleday is a work of art. While telling the story of a hard working, slightly struggling cyber engineer with a hard drug addiction; it also depicts a realistic representation of how \"our democracy has been hacked.\" It is also a very realistic life story with quotes like, \"I should just tell her what she wants to hear,\" and, \"We're all living in each other's paranoia.\" A must watch for all. There is no better role of Rami Malek than of Mr. Robot's Elliot Alderson."

      "content": "Mr. Robot is sweeping up all the important awards (Best drama, best actors) and well deserved! When i started to watch this series i didn't expect much, but it has blow me away even in the first episode. A dark story about what is right and what is wrong, and the madness that that question brings. The acting is solid and so is the directing.This character, Elliot, is really drawing me in. He's so fantastically flawed, beautifully destructive, sane and insane. His outlook on the world is perhaps pessimistic, or arrogant, but there is a truth in his words - his inner dialogue that comes across as well-written poetry. By the time you're on episode four, the confusion somewhat kicks in. This is okay though, as each character is slowly becoming themselves in the show and synchronizing.I can tell how each character is going to intertwine for the most part - but Elliot is the main attraction. I believe there are people out there who are like him; snorting Morphine 30's and taking Suboxone so he doesn't withdraw - a computer genius and natural poet, and a complete sociopath who abuses his power over computers and the internet to understand the human condition and even himself.This show is well worth your time; I think even the older crowds (I'm 22) - so basically people who would be my parents, can learn something from this show. They can catch a glimpse of what we're all really like: Sociopathic internet nerds who tweet and text and share, passing information around this sterile country as if it's the very air we breath. This show captures the current zeitgeist, or overall spirit of the times - Elliot is just the extremity, of course. A job well done. I give this show a 9/10"

      "title": "Novel",
      "content": "Going in with low expectation, not knowing anything about this show, the pilot turned out to offer a pleasant surprise. In short, the show is a bit unconventional, like a mix between an audio book and a TV show, but one rather well researched and executed.The acting is fairly good, the narrative style felt novel and fresh, and there's ample room for various subplots and story lines. The setting also felt real, as others have pointed out. Some interesting creative decisions were made, such as blatantly spelling out the antagonist, a company, by giving it an unmistakable name. It also makes subtle jokes and pokes fun of things probably only people in the IT industry would recognize.Whereas most shows and movies seem to throw all connection to reality straight out the window when it comes to IT related stuff, this show does not. In fact, it seems extraordinarily well researched for an entertainment piece. Being in that industry myself and having had a bit of \"fun\" as a youth, I'd have to say that overall the portrayal of IT security and hacking in this show is leaps and bounds more accurate than anything that has come before it, even if the attentive viewer would be able to spot some minute factual errors.Perchance even entertainment execs have realized they can no longer get away with silly and unbelievable things like \"magic picture enhance\", nerdy super hackers who as through divine insight guess their targets passwords in 1-2 attempts, or with peddling notions of tools that have weeks of artist design effort spent on them, for buttons that once clicked, reveal some information that would logically be impossible to get hold of through the channel used.It seems as though we finally have a show that doesn't treat its audience as idiots, and where the writers actually spent some time doing their homework. I'm just concerned that the show may be targeting too small an audience, an audience consisting of people who do not switch their brains off when they turn on the tele, and as such it may not be awarded a series contract.So far, highly recommended to tune into if you're interested in seeing something fresh and aren't allergic to narration (getting inside the mind of a somewhat odd protagonist), as there's quite lot of the latter."

The plot is top-notch and it is very suspenseful, it features some of the best tv characters ever, every actors nails their role. This show also features heavy amount of Hacking, I thought that was very neat and cool, but do not expect to see too much of that aspect, the focal point of this show is really the story. Definitely a 10 out of 10 for this one."

      "title": "A masterpiece",
      "content": "My favourite TV show of all time is the Office. Whilst that's great and all for some light hearted, switch off, bingeable entertainment, I really wanted to find something more story and character driven I could get into. And boy did I find it.This TV show is a masterpiece. The characters are so layered and interesting and this is only enhanced by the captivating performances from the talented cast. Malek gives a mysterious and at times sinister- yet somehow likeable- performance as Elliot. He ramps it up and knocks it out of the park when depicting Elliot's mental health issues, and this delivers one of the most painful, yet grounded depictions of mental health ever put on the screen. His performances alongside the brilliant Christian Slater create an incredible dynamic that carries the show forwards. The supporting cast are all great and are all given enough screen time to flesh them out, creating a truly three-dimensional set of characters.The writing is top tier, with tense story-lines and shocking, earth-shattering twists that change the entire complexion of the episodes before. At the end of episodes, I usually found myself with my jaw agape well into the credits. And it isn't afraid to put the tension on the back-burner to deliver some slower-paced, more human moments. This creates a nice, well-balanced mix with edge of the seat stuff one episode, then poignant, well-written character-defining moments the next. A great example that comes to mind is the heart-wrenching season 3, episode 8- 'Don't delete me', that succeeds the fast paced and exhilarating episodes 5,6 and 7.I'm on my second viewing of this show. Not only does it provide and entirely different yet equally entertaining viewing experience, it highlights how great the writing is. Little lines and clues snuck in right from the very start- the finale twist was in our face the entire time but it was so well hidden no one could see it. They had the whole story planned from the very beginning and it shows- this really is top tier storytelling.Every now and then, an episode will come along with a completely different format to other episodes in the season. It keeps the viewer on their toes, guessing when another 'bottle' style episode will come up- something that really enhances the viewing experience. And these are not present just for the sake of being different- they are all really well executed. From the bizarre yet genius sitcom style opening in the second season to the juggernaut of tension story-telling silent fourth season episode. And that's not even mentioning quite possibly the best episode of the entire show- An exhilarating yet devastating stage play in the middle of season 4.All of this is underscored by the incredible original score and inspired music choices. It's no surprise I like the music given my favourite artist of all time, M83 features heavily. M83's epic 'Intro' and 'Outro' perfectly fits the world-changing, high stakes drama and makes for deservingly monumental conclusions to the final two seasons respectively. I'm not even going to get started on the immense finale, otherwise I shall be typing this review long into the night.I have to save the best till last. There is not a hint of exaggeration when I say that this is the most beautiful motion picture I have ever seen. The thought behind every camera move, the colour palette and the attention to detail that goes into every shot, every frame is breath-taking. Negative spacing to enhance characters feelings of isolation and disconnect from one another- the framing means something. And I can say that about very few pieces of media. Even little things such as stylised title cards that change from episode to episode, the letter-boxing of the screen when the filming style changes to more conventional techniques of film-making in more dramatised, movie like episodes- it all adds up to a visually striking experience.There are not enough superlatives to use when describing this show. Its rock solid writing and gorgeous cinematography shows that TV is just as much cinema as the latest multi-million pound blockbuster release. A true masterpiece that I was always be indebted to the genius Sam Esmail and the entire cast and crew for. Goodbye, friend."

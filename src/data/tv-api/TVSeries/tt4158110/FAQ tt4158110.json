      "question": "What does that big E at E Corp stand for?",
      "answer": "It doesn't stand for anything and is open to interpretation. \"E\" is used a lot in generic tech corporate verbiage from e-mail to e-invites, where it usually means electronic.One popular theory is it may be \"Esmail Corp\" if you skip to the end of most of the episodes, the e corp logo shows up with the Esmail corp written. This obviously refers to the creator of the show, Sam Esmail. Evil Corp is also the name of a real life hacker group."

There's great chemistry between the lead characters who are all likable and have their own hilarious personal traits. The supporting cast are also excellent, Grandad Joe in particular I thought was very funny. I laughed a lot throughout the series and it also handled some sensitive subjects very well. I am glad that it's already been confirmed we will have a series 2!"

      "title": "Derry funny indeed",
      "content": "I'd almost given up on TV sit-coms, in fact the last one I really enjoyed was \"The I.T. Guys\" and how many years ago was that? Anyway, it was my wife who alerted me to this series and a quick look at the first two episodes of the second series found me looking up series one which she'd already watched and I have to say she wasn't wrong, as I found it absolutely hilarious.It reminded me of so many of my favourite sit-coms, like \"Father Ted\", naturally, \"Press Gang\" and yes, \"The I.T. Guys\", but it still has its own identity. Set in early 1990's Derry in Northern Ireland before the Good Friday Agreement came into place, it concerns the misadventures of a group of five young friends, four female and Irish, one male and English and by extension their eccentric families.It makes clever use of the political and religious backdrop for the comedy, the families in question being Roman Catholics living in the predominantly Protestant town of Derry, so that one episode has the hapless family attempting to head for a weekend in the country while an Orange Walk is in full swing, while another sees the young gang claim to have had holy visions in a chapel, with a statue of the Virgin Mary apparently \"smirking\" at them.The situations are amusingly set up, but it's the rapid-fire gags, often near-the-knuckle, which had me creasing myself as well as the individual characterisations themselves. I don't know who my favourite is amongst them but the central character of Erin, with her teenage crushes, literary pretensions and down-to-earth sensibilities probably shades it, although the hormonally imbalanced Michelle, uber-enthusiastic Clare and ditzy Orla and doormat James run her close and all get their share of the good lines on offer, not to mention their dysfunctional parents and grandparents too.All the episodes I've watched were of the same high standard with the only difficulty sometimes being the machine-gun-like Northern Irish delivery which can be a bit hard to pick up sometimes. That said I'm getting more than enough laughs from what I can see and hear so I'm not complaining too much. To all those many millions more people currently watching the appallingly bad \"Mrs Brown's Boys\" do yourself a favour and switch to this immediately."

      "content": "\"Derry Girls\" is a very clever comedy set at a girls school in Northern Ireland during 'the troubles'...the era when the IRA and the British Army were still at war with each other. Yet despite this situation, the show manages to be very light, funny and original....and is a treat worth seeing. My big complaint, however, is that the show is too good...to well written and with too likable characters. This is because the show was interrupted by COVID and I was left chomping on the bit waiting for MORE!!! In other words, the show really leaves you wanting more....and it's currently very frustrating as I want MORE!"

      "title": "Very funny but not for the easily offended",
      "content": "One might not think that a city so divided that what you call it identifies which side of the divide you are would be the first choice of where to locate a comedy; especially if it was set at a time when there were troops on the streets and the threat of sectarian violence was very real but somehow 'Derry Girls' works. As anybody in the UK or Ireland would guess this follows a group of Catholic girls in the city of Derry in Northern Ireland (had they been protestant it would no doubt have been called 'Londonderry Girls). The humour is such that people of whatever persuasion are likely to find it equally funny/offensive.The girls who attend an all-girls school are Erin, Orla, Clare and Michelle; in the first episode they are joined by Michelle's English cousin James who ends up going to the girls' school as it is feared he wouldn't survive at a boys' school. Over the course of the six episodes of the first season they get up to various amusing situations; James trying to find somewhere to go to the toilet in a girls' school; witnessing a possible miracle, which one of them knows was far from miraculous, getting stuck in the middle of an Orange Parade, and looking after visiting teenagers from Chernobyl amongst others.I feel this may be a very Marmite series; viewers will either love it or hate it and few are likely to be merely indifferent. Yes, it is puerile at times but it was done in a way that I found hilarious. The characters, both young and old, are all pretty funny with the cast doing a great job making them believable even when the situation gets comically exaggerated. While we do see evidence of The Troubles for the most part it remains in the background as the characters get on with their lives as though such things were perfectly normal. Overall I'd say that this certainly won't be for everybody but if you want a good laugh and aren't easily offend it I'd recommend giving it a go... I can't wait for the promised series two."

I especially liked Siobhan McSweeney who plays Sister Micheal. She's an absolute hoot and a real scene-stealer. Her deadpan dialogue delivery left me in splits. The script of this show is extremely witty. It really captures the angst and the indignation that the characters feel in the funniest way possible. I found myself remembering my \"rebel without a cause\" teenage days while watching this show. The principal cast - the four girls and James - share great chemistry and have done a fantastic job making sure the funny lines from the script really land. It's a pity this show only has 6 episodes. I liked it so much, I've seen it twice and really want more!"

And yet the other half is so hysterically funny that's it's worth the struggle.The series centers around 4 female high school friends living in Northern Ireland in the '80s. It's a strange setting for a broad comedy, yet it works, and it's fascinating to see how normal life is most of the time in a place famous for violence. Life goes on (as we're discovering in an increasingly dangerous America in 2019).The acting is wonderful, particularly Saoirse-Monica Jackson, who has the most expressive and rubbery face since Red Skelton, and an utterly hilarious Siobhan McSweeney as a snarky nun.I feel really sad that I can't make out so many of the jokes; I suspect if you're Irish you'd barely be able to breathe for laughing. Everyone should check this out."

The backdrop of the Troubles adds an interesting, somewhat dark element to the show which sets it apart from other comedies of its type.I was bored one night and figured I would give this show a go for 5-10 minutes on Netflix. Well I was instantly hooked. I'm so glad they're now in production of Season 3. Somehow the thick Northern Irish accents make the comedy even funnier.Smart, hilarious and absolutely addictive.

Set in 1990s Derry, McGee intricately intertwines the treacherous and realistic political undertones as an effective backdrop to successfully juxtapose the comedic on-goings in the lives of the core characters. It should win lots of awards."

I dont feel like The Troubles is a historical event that has been touched on very often in popular culture. ThatÂ´s why I found it so refreshing to see it in a comedic way through the eyes of Derry teenagers.The writing was spot on, you could never tell what was going to happen or what someone was going to say. Everything was just surprisingly hilarious all the time. If you can overlook the fact that the actors who are playing the teenagers are around ten years older than they should be, then youÂ´ll find their performances convincing. Some of them overacted sometimes (ErinÂ´s character is a little unnatural) but since the whole show is a bit nutty it kind of works."

There's no endless relationship drama or age-old clichÃ©s but instead the show is about the idiotic things a group of friends gets up to. The characters are original and fresh, each funny in their own way, working very well together. Standing out for me was Siobhan McSweeney as Sister Michael who is just so done with her students; her facial expressions are hilarious. But what really makes the show special is its setting. Set in the 90s in Northern Ireland it draws on a very specific historical situation (the Northern Ireland conflict) and transforms it brilliantly for comedy."

I find it refreshing that the series creators centeres a comedic story around a event in history know as the troubles, it's dark humor at its finest. I love the chemistry between the characters, especially the rivarly between Joe(Erins grandfather, played by Ian McElhinnely who recently starred in Game of thrones as Barristan Selmy) and Gerry(Erins father played byTommy Tiernan). There argument about the amount of chips-bags the family should buy for dinner is alone worth a watch. That is only one of many scenes absolutely hystericaly written and well-acted. The girls(aswell as their relatives) have there own gimmicks and they work really well with eachother throughout the episodes. Although the episodes are just over 20 minutes each they manage to tell a really good story with a defined beginning and ending. The reason why this haven't received ten stars from me is because I feel there is still alot more left to tell from the story about the girls in Derry. Hopefully something we will se more off in the future.I highly recommend these serie for anyone that likes these type off drama-comedies with some dark humor. For my own part I look forward to new episodes!"

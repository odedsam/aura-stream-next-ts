      "content": "One day Mr S.Pemberton will be recognised for the superb actor that he is.In \"Benidorm\" he plays the outwardly crass Garvey paterfamilias as a completely believable bloody - minded Manc,but his performance slowly reveals him to be a loving husband and father frustrated by his inability to articulate his emotions. From \"The League of Gentlemen\" to \"Inside No.9\" he has displayed the ability to act and perform comedy outside the box and in \"Happy Valley\" he has reached a new level as an embittered accountant who conceives a plan to hold his boss's daughter for ransom after being refused a pay rise.He passes the plan on to a local villain then finds his boss has changed his mind. Horror - stricken,he goes to the local nick where he meets sympathetic Sgt Cawood(the equally inspired Miss S.Lancashire),but runs off before she can get the truth out of him. Sgt Cawood has what you might call \"issues\" as her daughter committed suicide after giving birth to a child as a result of rape.Incidentally,she is buried in a graveyard near Sylvia Plath.Not surprisingly the child has \"issues\" too as does Sgt Cawood's sister(The mighty Miss S Finneran - Mrs Garvey in \"Benidorm\" -who is a recovering heroin addict. But please don't think that \"Happy Valley\" is a drama that disappears up it's own self - pitying bottom because all the women are too tough for that particular cliché to apply. Instead they front it out as the rapist is released from prison,gets a job with the local bad guy who is engineering the kidnapping and proceeds to rape the victim. Miss Lancashire is the best,toughest and cleverest female cop since Miss Frances McDormand in \"Fargo\".It would never surprise me if in the end she didn't feed the rapist into a woodchipper.I certainly don't fancy his chances of staying alive,let alone free. What with \"Happy Valley\" and the female - led \"The Crimson Field\",the BBC are leading TV drama out of its male - dominated somewhat patriarchal comfort - zone and giving us some real warts and all portraits of women who are not content to make tea and cakes while hubby rides home on the 4.55.from Victoria."

      "title": "A dark drama",
      "content": "Kevin Weatherill is an ordinary man doing an ordinary job as an accountant; he is not happy man though; he wants to send his daughter to a private school but his boss refuses to give him a raise. When he sees that another client is dealing drugs he comes up with a plan he will get this man to kidnap his boss's daughter and use the ransom to pay the school fees. This man agrees and the plan is set in motion. Keven later changes his mind but by now it is too late the girl is about to be kidnapped by a couple of men; including the thoroughly unpleasant ex-con Tommy Lee Royce. Royce is already known to the police; most notably Sgt Catherine Cawood; Royce raped her daughter leaving her pregnant but nothing could be proved. Following her daughter's suicide she is determined that Royce will get nowhere near her grandson and hopes to put him back in gaol as soon as possible she doesn't know about his latest offence though; nobody has reported the kidnap to the police an inaction that will have fatal consequences.When I started watching this I was expecting an English 'Fargo'; dark but still a bit funny well it was dark but there were few laughs; there weren't intended to be. Sarah Lancashire does a great job as Sgt Cawood and James Norton is genuinely disturbing as Royce. The rest of the cast are pretty solid too; most notably Steve Pemberton, who plays Weatherill; a man getting in over his head then blaming everybody but himself for the consequences of his actions, and George Costigan who plays Nevison Gallagher; father of the kidnapped girl. The story was gripping from start to finish with some shocks along the way and right up to the end I was unsure whether we'd get a happy conclusion or a tragic one. Overall I'd say that this was one of the best TV dramas I've watched for some time; it is well worth watching."

The acting from all involved is pretty excellent, especially Sarah Lancashire. An amazing performance, one that I hope gets serious awards recognition next year. I ultimately liked this more than I expected to, it's easy to get caught up in its plot and I also think that it does a great job moving it along at a surprisingly fast pace while also having some fantastic character moments. At times it gets a bit too over-the-top in its melodrama, but it never actually fails to emotionally hit home. I'm super ecstatic that it's coming back for a second season."

      "content": "The fact that Sgt Catherine Cawood is not a real person but a character played by an actress is completely 100% inconceivable. The portrayal is SO real in every aspect. It's real in every mannerism, in the shift between her persona as a private person and police officer, in the way she dresses, the way she wears her hair, her make up, the choices she makes and how she behaves. I've never seen a performance like it in my life. So extremely vulnerable, yet so extremely strong and when push comes to shove so extremely brave and tough. I for one would not want to cross her, for she would surely kick my behind severely, at the same time I sure would want her to talk to if ever I was victimized.As for the series, both one and two, the plot squeezes the characters so hard that it's sometimes unwatchable because you relate so intensely to the psychological pressures their under, both the good guys and the bad.An absolute must to watch!"

      "title": "BAFTA material",
      "content": "I thought 'Scott & Bailey\" to be extraordinary - and it is - but \"Happy Valley\" is gut wrenching, heart stopping, uncomfortable, and totally, totally brilliant. Firstly, nothing of quality can be created without a very good script, and Sally Wainwright's script is her best yet, and rivals her Scott & Bailey scripts. The dialogue crackles with its own rhythm, and sharp observations of modern life, while the emerging story is all at once shocking as it is at times ordinary.Happy Valley is the name the police use to describe this neck of the woods, around Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire. Drugs, unemployment, and the resultant crime are part of everyday life. Within this mix, we meet Catherine Cawood, a policewoman (formerly a detective) played by Sarah Lancashire. At the risk of throwing too many superlatives into this review, I believe Ms Lancashire should win a BAFTA in 2015 for her portrayal of a dedicated, often jaded, but loyal and determined copper. I *believed* her character, through her heroics, as well as her anti-heroism. Her ambivalence towards her young grandson is uncomfortable to watch, but completely understandable. It would be too easy to say that Sarah Lancashire *is* the show, but that would be unfair to some of the other fine performers, such as James Norton, George Costigan, Siobhan Finneran, and a stellar performance from Steve Pemberton, whose character, Kevin, sets off the whole mess of events which kept me breathless for the 6 episodes.The environment - around Hebden Bridge and Halifax, in West Yorkshire - is beautiful, and the buildings appear to have grown directly out of the landscape, and while this may be an ancient environment, the problems which occupy the police all belong in the modern world. I am really hoping there will be a Series 2."

They waited for 7 years before the final season, just to the child actor could grow up and the storyline could be believable. They didn't try to fit in another useless 6 seasons in the interim. They had a vision for the story from the start, and delivered only that over 9 years and 18 episodes.Astounding tv."

I am a cynical person just looking to find fault with television or film.I am very careful about what I allow into my head. This has to be about as good a television series as can possibly be. I do not even own a television. Watched via Netflix.I live in America and the tripe that's dispensed, made me give up my telly. I grew up in England and maybe biased since I really haven't seen anything to compare with British TV. In America in my opinion there is Aaron Sorkin's The Newsroom and The West Wing and David Kelly's Boston Legal. That is comparable to Happy Valley. Different shows but brilliant quality.Happy Valley has flawless acting, direction, score if that's the right term, script, pace,delivery, essentially perfect. Whether this is as a result of great casting, direction or simply brilliant actors, I haven't a clue. I am also an unemotional person and I really cannot see how television can get better. It's restored my faith somewhat, not enough to buy a TV but to realize that it can be that good.Just really pucker!"

      "title": "By far the best series I've seen on TV this year",
      "content": "I cannot praise this series enough. It has an air of realism about it from its location to the main actors. The lead sergeant Catherine Cawood and her sister are so ordinary, preoccupied with ordinary things, (no trendy,smarmy,clever middle class media interpretations of what ordinary people speak like dialog). Without exception every character is believable. With master classes in acting from the lead, her sister, her grandson and Tommy the maniac. The criminals are believably cruel and stupid in measure. The damaged and unfortunate are portrayed realistically but with compassion. No left wing idealism or right wing coldness that usually invades these type of program. The setting is the bleakest place I've ever seen, a beautiful English valley shrouded in mist, dampness and high rises. The streets and buildings are claustrophobic. Most of all the story is credible, consistent and finely paced. raw emotions are not avoided and dysfunction is everywhere. And yet there's something noble in sergeant Catherine Cawood."

      "title": "Simply the Best",
      "content": "The original \"Happy Valley\" six-parter has to be the best, or at least the best I've ever seen, police dramas series. The story is brilliant, the casting, acting and direction superb and the absence of 'background dramatic music' is a God send which adds so much to the overall ambience. Viewers are actually able to hear the dialogue and aren't distracted by the annoyance of entirely unnecessary noise which does nothing to enhance the drama, in fact, it diminishes it.Sarah Lancashire is phenomenal in her lead role and it's hard to believe that anyone could have been betteras she tries to deal with the horrors of her past while carrying out her duties of the present. In the rest of the cast, James Norton exudes menace as the main villain, while Steve Pemberton and Joe Armstrong are utterly believable as the ill-matched baddies. Siobhan Finneran is wonderful and so realistic as the understated sister, trying desperately to deal with her own demons while also supporting her police sergeant sibling. The rest of the cast, including Rhys Connahr as young Ryan who is the epitomy of a child who simply doesn't understand what's going on, is just perfect.I defy anyone to watch this series and not be afected by the raw emotions of the story, not to be drawn in and wonder how they might react in similar, or even remotely similar, circumstances. This is Sally Wainwright at her very, very best, supported by a cast at the very top of their game.Absolutely fantastic series, brilliant throughout. 10 out of 10 is the least I can give it."

      "content": "The most intense, well written, well acted crime series I've ever seen on television. For six weeks I've been hooked on a story that uses a police drama as a framework for the human emotions that are at the core of this fantastic series. Steve Pemberton (The League of Gentlemen, Inside No 9) as the self-interested accountant out of his depth when a kidnapping plot goes horribly wrong was brilliant and James Norton was easily one of the best psychopaths I've ever seen in a television drama. There was real depth to his character and I expect he was hated by viewers as much as Joffre in Game of Thrones nonsense police officer. But it was Sarah Lancashire's show all the way as the tough, no-nonsense, but damaged police officer. At first I thought this was going to go the way of the film Fargo, with it's kidnapping-gone-wrong scenario, but by the start of the second episode it was clear that it was going to take a different path. Be warned though, it's dark and unsettling with moments of sudden shocking violence, especially at the end of the fourth episode, where I was left shaking at the sheer intensity of it all. Better than anything American crime dramas have had to offer us over the past year, it was brilliant. Absolutely bloody brilliant!"

      "title": "Stunning UK cop drama",
      "content": "Happy Valley is simply one of the very best British police dramas and there is a lot of high quality competition. There are a series of unique factors that come together to make this such a gritty and compelling series.First is the location - shot in the grim valleys of West Yorkshire around rural Hebden Bridge near Bradford, Halifax and Leeds which is unlike the more urban or picturesque locations often used in UK cops shows. The dreary weather, the working class cast, the ubiquitous thick Yorkshire accents and the economic struggles of the former coal mining area are front and centre.Second is the fact that the central character, Police Sergeant Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), is a rank and file cop and not a more glamourous Detective is a major departure from normal British police show casting. The tough daily routine of the uniformed constables she leads and not the murder investigations of the CID is what is mostly shown on screen.Third is the elongation of the gap between series 2 and 3 done deliberately around the other central character, that of Cath Cawood's grandson Ryan (Rhys Connah). Rhys was 8 and 10 in the first two series but the plot lines and subject matter of Series 3 needed to be filmed around the reactions and impact on a mid-adolescent boy and so the writer and director Sally Wainwright waited 6 years for the character of Ryan to grow from a child to a near adult sized teenager and the impact of this decision adds a fantastic and realistic dimension to the story line.Finally is the ending of the show in Episode 6 of Season 3 (as it is clear there will be no more seasons), which features a stunningly intense climactic encounter between Sergeant Cawood and the other central character psychopathic killer (and father of Ryan) Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton) that rewrites all the norms of every preceding police drama of this type in a most satisfying and dramatic way.Happy Valley has it all, fabulous dark and brooding locations, tough and gritty working class Yorkshire realism, superb and award winning acting from a stellar cast of veterans and newcomers like young Rhys Connah and a plot line that is taut, compelling, intense and gripping. In a country renowned for its incredible quality police dramas, Happy Valley is a true standout."

It is impossible not to feel her passion for policing, her incredible pain at the lost of her daughter and the disappointment she has in her failed marriage and ex husband. The fury I feel towards Kevin Weatherill for his stupid and selfish act that culminates in the horror that is this show, is testament to Steve Pemberton's brilliant acting.

The story itself it terrific but sitting in the middle is Catherine Cawood, the dedicated, honest, seen-it-all-before, no-nonsense copper. The writer who opened the story with the confrontation with a smack-head allowed some cracking dialogue to kick the series off and show us the character we will grow to like and care for. The BAFTA's hers!"

      "title": "Solid Brit Crime Drama",
      "content": "The Brits have a way with crime dramas and it isn't just the gray overcast horizon. No, free of the Hollywood shine there's a palpable sense of struggling with the added weight of bad people intersecting, and changing, the lives of everyday folk. In a very personal struggle we find a survivor, a mother and a police woman, who rises to be more a real heroine.I was drawn to Happy Valley on a TV sight that said something like it was a \"across the pond\" slight relative of the American TV series Fargo. After completing it I have to say not so much. It isn't really too similar at all though I must say I thoroughly enjoyed Fargo as I did Happy Valley. Stripped of the cleverness of Hollywood it trades a gritty story you feel is just much more real. The series rides on the many times perfect performance of Sarah Lancashire as police detective Catherine Cawood. Cawood carries the load and is supported with a spot-on cast morphing her from a mother whose daughter committed suicide after giving birth to a illegitimate son (Catherine, his grandmother, is raising him) to become not only a survivor, but a real heroine in her seemingly unlikely role as a police officer. I don't want to give the story away except to say it is built, and evolves, powerfully. One must watch in sometimes graphic detail how criminals and innocent people, some who become criminals quite unexpectedly, intersect until our unlikely heroine saves the day and finally comes to real healing herself.Also of note is the performance of James Norton as criminal Tommy Lee Royce. The Brits do this kind of gritty crime drama brilliantly. A hearty recommendation here."

      "content": "Sarah Lancashire, one of the biggest stars in UK television, delivers her career highlight. Lancashire's character is as complex, admirable and downright remarkable as you could ever imagine. Gripping storylines that never drift into farce territory like so many other crime dramas. At times, Happy Valley is an almost visceral experience."

      "title": "Excellent British Drama",
      "content": "My wife and I were surfing the net one lazy Sunday afternoon and I found Happy Valley on Netflix. BBC television frequently has shows we enjoy so we pulled it up and began watching the series. It's started off slow and it takes a bit to catch up with the language and how it flows but we're good at understanding the dialog. The longer we watched the more we became engrossed in the story line. I'm a retired cop after 30 years on the job and yes there were some minor flaws in basic cop stuff but I'm forgiving ....it's a show, not reality. The writing and acting were impeccable. The story flows and the many strands of the story began to come into one main story. We recommend you just sit and watch as it unfolds, you will enjoy the story. The individual actors had their characters spot on and really developed their individualism. Human behavior and rationalization of ones actions were mingled throughout the characters. Despicable, weak minded individuals, criminal types and then the sociopath one that really stands out from the minor league criminals...it's all in this show. Honestly, we watched the entire series ( 6 hours ) in one afternoon and evening. I've already checked and noted that the BBC has renewed the show for another season so we can see the Sergeant build her character even more, along with the supporting cast."

      "title": "British character drama at its very best",
      "content": "The best thing on TV since Broadchurch, and it may even have the edge. Sarah Lancashire's performance is the glue that holds the whole story together, but every character is painted in broad strokes without a cliché among them.Everyone is flawed and for that reason human. Brilliant writing and acting brings them to life. Sgt Catherine Cawood is a character for our time, struggling to fight off the kind of crime that becomes rife when times are bad. Criminals don't pay tax and don't use banks so even though crime is not supposed to pay, with cuts in the police service, it does.*spoiler alert* Catherine is fighting her own demons, guilt over her daughter's suicide and an ill-advised affair with her ex is preying on her mind. Episode 5 was a touch of genius, showing how this strong woman could be destroyed not just by a violent attack but by the sheer feeling of futility in its aftermath.By the end of the episode she is finding her way back and I for one can't wait for the final episode. For anyone who says there is no good writing for female actors, then this is the series that will change your mind.The men are great too, btw. James Norton as the sociopath Tommy Lee Royce could have played him completely black and white, but there is a huge amount of grey in him. The small scenes where he skips along the wall of his mum's house harks at a childhood missed and attempts to recapture it. And he also says a lot with facial expressions, just as Lancashire can say more with a loaded glance than a whole monologue.Brilliant piece of TV. Can you tell I like it? Catch it if you can, but try to get the whole series on iPlayer. It is a real builder of suspense and worth the time investment."

      "content": "Absolutely incredible Drama with a capital \"D\". Please tell me they are talking with Sarah Lancashire about a second series.I look forward to seeing Sarah, the cast and production team at all the award ceremonies this year.BRILLIANT!! and we have only seen 4 episodes. The locations, the camera work,the wardrobe and the realistic make up all combine to give the episode such realism it is at times genuinely frightening.In my experience fear generated when watching TV comes only with groundbreaking drama of the highest order. The cast leave me breathless with admiration at such fine performances from all involved but like all great team efforts there is one shining light giving a career best performance as Catherine Cawood that is Sarah Lancashire."

      "content": "Review updated:- So glad Sally Wainwright didn't listen to my original view(leave it at a stand alone series) The third series was pretty much the best thing I have seen on British TV in this genre.The Trilogy is fabulous.Original review:- I cannot fault this Police/Crime drama. The writer has proved again, as with Scott and Bailey she has a feel for UK Policing and the consequences for the victims, offenders and officers involved of the crime. I was pretty much in tears at one point following one of the scenes and was astonished at how amazing Sarah Lancashires' performance was. Thiswas truly BAFTA material all round with faultless performances that's why 10/10. I sincerely hope they do not have a second series but let this remain a one off spectacular piece of TV. I understand a second series has been discussed but why would you risk blemishing a perfectly constructed drama?"

Lewis is concerned that Royce is ill-treating Ann and plans to kill her when the full ransom is received but is savagely beaten by Royce when he tries to intervene on her behalf.

Catherine recovers in hospital and is visited by Ann, who asks her not to tell her mother about her rape by Royce. On discharge, Catherine is despondent since Royce is still at large.",

      "question": "Are all of the songs that Shy Baldwin sings from the period? Any new material?",
      "answer": "The soundtrack for \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" Season 3, is packed with nostalgic tunes-perhaps even more so than seasons past, as this marks the first time the series has incorporated original songs.These tracks, written by Curtis Moore and Tom Mizer, can be heard during the numerous performances that Shy Baldwin gives while on tour with Midge. Shy is played by Leroy McClain, but the vocals actually come from Broadway singer Darius de Haas, so that's who you're hearing when Shy is on stage. Season 3 also includes an elaborate synchronized swimming number to a show-tune classic, and even Sterling K. Brown gets a chance to sing.Source: Bustle, Dec 6, 2019"

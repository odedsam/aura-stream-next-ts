      "question": "Given the ruckus narrated during the whole season 2 (i.e. the assassination of a city judge in another state, several shootings involving organized crime members from the whole Midwest, and an alleged drug and gun-running interstate operation, etc), how could a federal prosecutor, or any federal law agency for that matter, not be concerned by, at least, one of these cases? And wouldn't be more efficient to sue every party within a federal jurisdiction?Also, what exactly falls into a state policeman's authority when investigating in another state?",

      "question": "How does this series relate to Fargo (1996)?",
      "answer": "In the movie , Carl Showalter buries the case of money in some snow by a barbwire fence. In the Fargo (2014), it is shown in a flashback that Stavros Milos discovers the case of money.Both the series and the movie take place in the state of Minnesota. The characters and themes are similar, in which the small town Midwest culture to keeping things calm and status quo, and wrapping things up nicely clashes when some other city forces arrive. Also, similar to the Coen brothers writing (and somewhat like Tarantino writing), many of the character have a strong sense of morals and principles which leads to conflicts over small details. There are also intricate storytelling, monologues and parables similar to these directors' movie style. Edit"

      "question": "Season 1: Why did Lester confront Malvo in the elevator?",
      "answer": "Successfully managing to escape prosecution for the murder of his wife gave Lester a new outlook on life after years of being emasculated by everyone he knew. After shifting the blame to his more successful and passive aggressive brother, Lester's life changed dramatically: marrying a trophy wife, moving to a large and expensive house and starting his own insurance agency. Lester was convinced that he was invincible after an entire life of failure, so when he spotted Malvo for the first time in a year, Lester no longer feared him and somewhat thought that Malvo was the catalyst for his turnaround. Lester either wanted to thank Malvo or confront him (believing that he was finally strong enough), but unfortunately he chose to do so at a time that compromised an important job that Malvo had been working on for six months."

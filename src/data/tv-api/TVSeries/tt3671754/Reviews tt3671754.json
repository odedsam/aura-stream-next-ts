      "content": "Let me start by saying that i've watched each episode at least 5 times, there is an uncatchable tempo, non-stop jokes and outstanding performances from actors, the jokes are referred to both pop culture and intellectual subjects, it's partly absurd partly black comedy, and of course there is a story. i've never enjoyed any serie as much as this one, highly recommended"

      "content": "We met Selcuk Aydemir with Calgi Cengi and Isler Gucler.They were great works.Selcuk Aydemir's works have a quality who you can't see very often.Because of that we all buried some bad thoughts about works.Before i criticize 2 things i want to write Kardes Payi is best show in Turkish televisions right now.1-Aydemir must give up glorifying violence almost every episode. There's no episode you ran a dialog like this: -oh how they beat me good i'm like reborn......2-Main characters problem M.Cemcir and A.Kural came to us as a inventor brothers.They got ideas like no physic professor can find.In the series we have no idea how this two guys could be scientists\\inventors.We didn't see them watching a documentary,we didn't see them reading a book or quoting from some science men in a conversation.Nothing!!They are typical unemployed neighborhood boys have suddenly an invention about ending oil problem on the earth plus save the environment.Probably they saw problem about that and after 10 episodes we learned they are not inventors they're just two guys who tries to improve they're father's invention by the way we learned after 10 episodes they're father was a retired physic professor.So I want to ask then why first 10 episodes they act like they've got an invention? plus even they're not inventors they must know great physics for improving invention. Finally i want to congrats Sinasi Yurtsever,Ali Ihsan Varol(one of my favorite guys),Berfu Ongoren,Ipek Yaylacioglu and Korhan Erduran from cast.If show still best in the Turkish TV.All crew must be thankful those 5 actors\\actresses."

It was funny when I watched it before I reached maturity, but I didn't need to watch it again to interpret it. I wish the parts played by Seda Minister had been kept shorter. I guess it's because I couldn't bear to watch \"Isler Gucler\" for more than 20 minutes."

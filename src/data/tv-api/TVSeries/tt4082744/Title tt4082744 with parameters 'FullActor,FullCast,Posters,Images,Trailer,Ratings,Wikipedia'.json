He buries the sack near a standing stone. Time lapse shows all but the decorated gold handle of the stick decaying, and the shot pans upwards to reveal Andy and Lance walking across the field in present-day Danebury, detecting as they go. Having had no success, they decide to look up the hill. The jewel is shown again, still buried, at the beginning of subsequent episodes.\r\nChristmas Special (2015)\r\nSeries 3 (2017)\r\nIn March 2017, the BBC released a statement confirming the filming of a third and final series. The six-episode third series was filmed in the summer of 2017 and aired weekly on BBC Four from 8 November 2017.\r\nThe first episode ends with a historical timeline sequence, backed by the song \"Magpie\" by The Unthanks. Reviewing the opening episode for The Guardian, Sam Wollaston said: \"Mackenzie Crook and Toby Jones shine in the third and final series of this beautifully written and performed slice of life.\"\r\nChristmas Special (2022)\r\nA 75-minute Christmas special was announced in May 2022. The episode aired on BBC Two on 26 December 2022.\r\nProduction\r\nDetectorists was announced by the BBC on 31 January 2014. The producer was Adam Tandy and the series was a Channel X and Lola Entertainment co-production.\r\nAlthough the series is set in Essex, it was mainly filmed in neighbouring Suffolk, with Framlingham used as a major location. Other locations used in filming include Orford, where Orford Primary School was used as the outside of Becky's school, Great Glemham, where interior pub scenes were filmed, and Ipswich. In series 2, the round-tower church at Aldham was used as a recurring location. One location in Essex was used in Detectorists: the scenes involving Lance's girlfriend Toni's houseboat, 'Elsie', were filmed at Paper Mill Lock, Little Baddow. Locations were sourced by Creative England.\r\nUpon deciding to finish the show at the end of series 3, Crook commented \"it took a while to realise that I did want to do six more episodes to finish. I don't want to make any sort of big, dramatic announcement that 'never again', but I can't see myself going back to it.\"\r\nDespite ruling out further episodes at the end of series 3, in December 2020 Crook alluded to the possibility that a fourth series was not out of the question, saying \"I'm just starting the process of thinking 'yeah, we should get the old band back together'.\"\r\nWhen asked about the possibility of Detectorists returning for a fourth series after the 2022 Christmas special, Crook responded \"Iâ€™m going to give the same answer I gave at the end of the third series; \"probably not\". I guess, dot dot dot, I mean, where can you go after this?\".\r\nBroadcast\r\nInternationally, the series premiered in Australia on 9 November 2015 on BBC First. In the United States, the series premiered on streaming subscription service Acorn TV in August 2015.\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nSeries one of Detectorists was met with positive reviews from a number of UK and US media outlets. David Renshaw, writing for The Guardian, had particular praise for the \"delightful double-act\" Mackenzie Crook and Toby Jones. Renshaw points to the \"biggest ratings BBC4 has ever had for a comedy\" as evidence that \"Detectorists has clearly struck the sort of gold that Lance and Andy spend hours sweeping the fields for\". Rupert Hawksley, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was particularly impressed with Crook's \"first-rate writing\" and remarked in his review that series one \"has all the markings of a classic sitcom\".\r\nEllen E. Jones of The Independent said that while the show \"requires some patience... it has turned out to be one of the best new sitcoms of the year\".\r\nIn the US media, The New York Times writer Mike Hale describes Detectorists as a \"distinctive creation â€“ not for everyone, but bound to be fiercely loved by those who fall into its rhythms\". Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times \"can't recommend it enough\", saying: \"Like the ordinary lives it magnifies, Detectorists has the air of seeming to be small and immense at once, to be about hardly anything and almost everything. It is full of space and packed with life.\"\r\nWhen the programme returned for a second series, the response was again positive.\r\nOn the completion of the third and final series, Radio Times website reviewer Mark Braxton wrote \"The series finale... is one of the most satisfying conclusions ever. Series one and two both ended in clever and memorable ways: bittersweet and punch-the-air respectively. But the series three finale has a real poetry to it; Crook seems to be saying: \"Yes, that's where we'll leave it â€“ I'm happy with that.\"\r\nThe series has also received praise for its authentic portrayal of \"a gentler side to maleness and male bonding\", with Ben Dowell of The Times describing the show as being \"steeped in a gentle kindness that I hadn't seen before\".\r\nA book of academic essays about the series, Landscapes of Detectorists, was published by Uniformbooks in 2020.\r\nAwards and nominations",

Wary of others muscling in on their patch, Andy and Lance decide to keep their operations secret, but Sophie seems to know more than she should.

The producer was Adam Tandy and the series was a Channel X and Lola Entertainment co-production.</p><p>Although the series is set in Essex, it was mainly filmed in neighbouring Suffolk, with Framlingham used as a major location. Other locations used in filming include Orford, where Orford Primary School was used as the outside of Becky's school, Great Glemham, where interior pub scenes were filmed, and Ipswich. In series 2, the round-tower church at Aldham was used as a recurring location. One location in Essex was used in Detectorists: the scenes involving Lance's girlfriend Toni's houseboat, 'Elsie', were filmed at Paper Mill Lock, Little Baddow. Locations were sourced by Creative England.</p><p>Upon deciding to finish the show at the end of series 3, Crook commented \"it took a while to realise that I did want to do six more episodes to finish. I don't want to make any sort of big, dramatic announcement that 'never again', but I can't see myself going back to it.\"</p><p>Despite ruling out further episodes at the end of series 3, in December 2020 Crook alluded to the possibility that a fourth series was not out of the question, saying \"I'm just starting the process of thinking 'yeah, we should get the old band back together'.\"</p><p>When asked about the possibility of Detectorists returning for a fourth series after the 2022 Christmas special, Crook responded \"Iâ€™m going to give the same answer I gave at the end of the third series; \"probably not\". I guess, dot dot dot, I mean, where can you go after this?\".</p><br/><h3>Broadcast</h3><p>Internationally, the series premiered in Australia on 9 November 2015 on BBC First. In the United States, the series premiered on streaming subscription service Acorn TV in August 2015.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Critical response</h4><p>Series one of Detectorists was met with positive reviews from a number of UK and US media outlets. David Renshaw, writing for The Guardian, had particular praise for the \"delightful double-act\" Mackenzie Crook and Toby Jones. Renshaw points to the \"biggest ratings BBC4 has ever had for a comedy\" as evidence that \"Detectorists has clearly struck the sort of gold that Lance and Andy spend hours sweeping the fields for\". Rupert Hawksley, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was particularly impressed with Crook's \"first-rate writing\" and remarked in his review that series one \"has all the markings of a classic sitcom\".</p><p>Ellen E. Jones of The Independent said that while the show \"requires some patience... it has turned out to be one of the best new sitcoms of the year\".</p><p>In the US media, The New York Times writer Mike Hale describes Detectorists as a \"distinctive creation â€“ not for everyone, but bound to be fiercely loved by those who fall into its rhythms\". Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times \"can't recommend it enough\", saying: \"Like the ordinary lives it magnifies, Detectorists has the air of seeming to be small and immense at once, to be about hardly anything and almost everything. It is full of space and packed with life.\"</p><p>When the programme returned for a second series, the response was again positive.</p><p>On the completion of the third and final series, Radio Times website reviewer Mark Braxton wrote \"The series finale... is one of the most satisfying conclusions ever. Series one and two both ended in clever and memorable ways: bittersweet and punch-the-air respectively. But the series three finale has a real poetry to it; Crook seems to be saying: \"Yes, that's where we'll leave it â€“ I'm happy with that.\"</p><p>The series has also received praise for its authentic portrayal of \"a gentler side to maleness and male bonding\", with Ben Dowell of The Times describing the show as being \"steeped in a gentle kindness that I hadn't seen before\".</p><p>A book of academic essays about the series, Landscapes of Detectorists, was published by Uniformbooks in 2020.</p><h4>Awards and nominations</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\">Year</th><th scope=\"col\">Award</th><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">Recipient</th><th scope=\"col\">Result</th><th scope=\"col\">Ref.</th></tr><tr><td><span>2015</span></td><td><span>British Academy Television Award (BAFTA)</span></td><td><span>Best Situation Comedy</span></td><td><i>Detectorists</i></td><td style=\"background: #9EFF9E; color: #000; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"yes table-yes2 notheme\">Won</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>2016</span></td><td><span>British Academy Television Award (BAFTA)</span></td><td><span>Best Male Comedy Performance</span></td><td><span>Toby Jones</span></td><td style=\"background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2 notheme\">Nominated</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>2018</span></td><td><span>British Academy Television Award (BAFTA)</span></td><td><span>Best Male Comedy Performance</span></td><td><span>Toby Jones</span></td><td style=\"background: #9EFF9E; color: #000; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"yes table-yes2 notheme\">Won</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>2018</span></td><td><span>Rose d'Or</span></td><td>Rose d'Or for Sitcom</td><td><i>Detectorists</i></td><td style=\"background: #9EFF9E; color: #000; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"yes table-yes2 notheme\">Won</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>"

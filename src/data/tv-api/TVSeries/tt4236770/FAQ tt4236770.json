      "answer": "Some are some are not Native American / First Nation.*Gil (Chief Rainwater) is of Mexican/Comanche heritage. *Kelsey Asbille (Monica Dutton) is of Chinese descent, according to her bio. *Mo Brings Plenty (Mo) is Oglala Lakota. *Atticus Todd Anishinaabe (Ben Waters) is Native but I'm not clear in what tribe. *Tokala Black Elk (Sam Stands Alone) is also Oglala Lakota and has an uncanny resemblance to his Sioux ancestors. *Rudy Ramos (Felix Long) is of Comanche and Kiowa descendant. *Tanaya Beatty (Avery) is half First Nation (Not clear of which tribe) and half Indian (Asian version, not North American) *Martin Sensmeier (Martin) is Tlingit (People of the Tides) of whom are known in the Pacific NorthwestWant to add a little clarity to the muddy H2O: *Heritage is not the correct word. *Ethnicity is more likely the descriptor of most \"Native\" or whatever moniker currently in vogue term to use. *Mestizo probably describes most accurately \"First Nations\" in the show, if that."

      "question": "Why are some of the ranch workers branded with the Yellowstone logo and others aren't and what does it mean to be branded?",
      "answer": "Those not branded are just hired hands and those branded are former lowlifes who now belong to the ranch even those with the Dutton name. Those with the brand are protected by the Dutton family, not just from those outside the ranch but from disgruntled workers within the ranch.Those who are branded are to live up to the brand. Betraying the ranch has consequences. First the brand is cut off then the transgressor is killed and taken to the Long Black Train."

      "question": "What is the Train Station?",
      "answer": "Also known as the Long Black Train. It is a rural canyon area south of the Montana-Wyoming border in a county where there is no living person within a hundred miles, no law enforcement, no judge and jury of your peers. It is where the Duttons send their enemies or those who disrespected the ranch to either be killed and/or disposed of into the canyon. It is how Lloyd Pierce put it, how the west was won."

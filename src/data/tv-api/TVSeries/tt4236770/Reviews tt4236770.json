      "content": "Yellowstone has easily become one of my favorite shows on tv. It's now going on to season five and every season has been fantastic so far. Almost every episode of every season is excellent and moves the story forward. There are some slow parts and slow episodes but that's not a bad thing. There is plenty of action and drama to keep everyone satisfied. The cast is just about perfect as they all give incredible performances. The cinematography is as good as it gets on tv and shows just how beautiful Montana is. I am completely hooked on this show and one of the few shows I still watch live because I love it that much."

      "title": "Macho, macho man",
      "content": "A friend recommended it, she loves the setting which I agree is beautiful. But the show itself suffers from poor writing. The central conflict, much like in Succession, is the same throughout the show. Although the antagonists might change, they're always after Dutton's land for some reason or another. And after some 40 hours, that's getting a bit old.Taylor Sheridan does a poor job introducing us to this world I know absolutely nothing about. After the first episode I had absolutely no f-n idea what was going on with the cattle conflict and who all these people were in relation to one another.But the only thing more one-note than the story are the characters. Kevin Costner grumbles, growls and chuckles his way through every episode. Web Bentley mopes around with a jaw so clenched it could produce diamonds. Kelly Reilly acts like a maniacal a-hole to absolutely everyone she encounters, yet we are to believe she's some sort of business genius desired by everyone. The second son and his Indian wife are so bland they melt into the wallpaper. The characters remain the same. No growth or change.There is no one to root for. Am I supposed to sympathize with John Dutton, a whiny corrupt charmless billionaire who supposedly is the main protagonist? Then give me something to work with. It's not that a protagonist has to be a good guy. Tony Soprano is a perfect example of a ruthless a-hole one couldn't help rooting for. But Dutton? \"My family has owned this land for 200 years, and if we let someone build a casino/hotel/golf course/resort/airport next to it people can't afford to live here.\" But you holding on to the land also means that no one can live there, regardless of their income. It's a conflict which doesn't make sense. Or he's just simply a hypocrite.One other thing which doesn't make sense is why they kill people who want to leave. When it happened the first time I thought it was because Dutton was a secret kingpin of crime or something, with his ranch a front for drug running or whatever. But no, people just can't leave. I guess, because after some 40 hours we still don't have a proper explanation for it. The small stuff that they have been up to at the Dutton ranch doesn't seem to justify killing everyone who wants to leave. One little problem with this is that this cowboy world seems kind of small. People from different ranches and states know each other. One would think that someone would go \"Hey, whatever happened to these 20 guys who went to work for Dutton and were never heard from again?\".The episode structure is pretty much the same. At least one fist and/or gun fight per episode, and it's so boring. Although they mix it up in one late episode and have a knife fight instead. I guess that's progress.If I see one more montage set to cheesy country music I am going to kill myself."

      "content": "Kevin Costner is the patriarch presiding over a dynastic ranch that is the size of some countries. His way of life is being impinged on by resort developers, tribal rights, and the authority of the state of Montana. Reminiscent of Rock Hudson in \"Giant\", he is trying to hold on to the old ways.\"Yellowstone\" develops quickly with little introduction, yet its story unravels with the natural pace of a wilderness day, pausing for tribal rituals, cowboy conventionalities, and political machinations. It's a far flung undertaking that dwells on the seams between laws and justice, family and friendships.Costner fills his character's boots naturally, it seems. He is a world-wearied man who has seen too much and lied too often. The land and the family are his lifeblood. He can hear the footsteps coming his way, but he can only fulfill his role-out of habit as much as loyalty.Although some action is a little confusing due to lack of explanation, it feels natural, as if the viewer is getting a genuine slice-of-life glimpse into another world. I hope the resolution of this saga includes an emotional payoff that justifies its breadth and its attention to details.Update 7/20/18: After four episodes, this series has a strong voice and a persistent rhythm. We learn the fullness of each story, from roots to fruits. I am increasing my grade to \"9\"."

And, as exciting as the Netflix phenomenon may be, I have tracked literally dozens of shows that ran out of quality writing by the second season.

      "title": "Dutton family and their sprawling Montana ranch.",
      "content": "This series has been on since 2018 but now is the first time I have watched any of it. Last night I completed the first episode of the first season, it runs right near 90 minutes. As to introduce the Dutton family we see they have powerful influence in their valley but are fending off \"attacks.\" One from developers who want to put up condos. Another from the neighboring Native reservation looking to get some of their land back plus some livestock. To help deal with all that and the sprawling size of his ranch Dutton (played authentically by 60-something Kevin Costner) has several grown Cowboy sons and a helicopter with a dedicated pilot.The reason I watched episode one of season one (on Peacock streaming) was to get the feel for the Dutton family because I am currently watching the ten episodes of the more recent Taylor Sheridan program \"1883\" which is the prequel of sorts. It was (fictionally) in 1883 that the Dutton family from Tennessee joined a larger group to wagon train from Fort Worth Texas to \"somewhere in the West\". They must have stopped when they reached Montana.Again it is all fiction but if we look at the ages of the men, and the fact that Costner was born in 1955, his character would probably be the great, great grandson of the Dutton patriarch (played by Tim McGraw) in \"1883\". E.g. With sons born about 1875, 1900, 1925, and the 1950s.\"Yellowstone\" is a really fine series, the actors are all first-rate, the cinematography and sound are excellent. It just ins't the kind of program I could get invested in and continue to watch. It is hard to find characters with redeeming qualities and I really don't long-term enjoy programs which constantly focus on arguments and fights, and often killing. Now in my 70s I prefer to spend time watching \"pleasant\" stories.NB - \"1883\" is a really fine and interesting series, how it authentically depicts the great hardship of pulling up roots and traveling through unknown territories to try to find a new life in a new place."

They're like the Cartwrights of Bonanza only not nearly as honorable. Hell, they're not as honorable as the Eweings of Dallas. Game of Thrones had a huge cast that was constantly being pared away each week. This made it believable, knowing anyone could get the ax at anytime. Watching this family being battered, beat up, blown to bits, rolled over in trucks, and shot multiple times with assault rifles, and surviving to do it all over again gets a little tedious. The best moments to me are when they behave like real people with real emotions and real risks of losing a lifestyle that's been lost for decades already. Rip and Beth have a compelling relationship to watch and admire. They don't need it amped up any further by manufactured drama that can never measure up to the natural chemistry between them. I like this show well enough when I get an unexpected look at the practical life of a cowboy or the grueling effort it takes to sustain life on the reservation. I don't need Ninja's or Militia clowns planning secrets attacks to enjoy the superior writing or the grandvperformances of the actors."

Season 4 often became an opportunity to advertise horse training which may appeal to some but I was completely bored by it. Sheridan apparently has a spin off series, 6666, planned that will expand on this which I will simply avoid. Season 5 has John Dutton becoming the Montana Governor who's only purpose is to protect his ranch from those who would like to requisition a portion of his land in order to develop \"vacation\" properties for the wealthy and build an airport. Yawn. That story line gets even more boring than the horse training (the only positive was the introduction of his advisor as Governor who besides being a lesbian had some surprising qualities). Almost equally uninteresting is Beth Dutton's never ending effort to punish Summer Higgins (Piper Perabo), an activist against the killing of animals and a vegan as well as being her father's \"advisor\" and apparent \"love\" interest. After a beat down that seemed to have resolved that, Beth's continued sniping has become challenging to watch. Beth Dutton was always a hard core B*tch (which she is proud of) but that was the part of her character that made viewers like her but her vindictive attitude is turning many away from her. It may be time for Taylor Sheridan to focus on other projects or return Yellowstone to what brought so many people to the series in the first place and abandoned the most recent storylines."

Too much here annoys me, and beyond the writing and general direction of the show, coming in second in the annoyance department is the character Kayce and his annoyingly present son. Throughout season one in its entirety nearly nothing happens that isn't contrived - and that's just how the show feels. One silly episode synopsis read something about John Dutton's secret, which is brought up as a concern, regarding elections, by a governor to a AG candidate (which is not John Dutton) - it's utterly absurd. And that's this show. Absurd. Driving with your son, have a gun in the glove, and see a strange van on the side of the road? Well, of course you go full vigilante with your little irritating son present. And of course this character is a SEAL - cliche? Stick a fork in it.

Are there unknown relationships that surface between, say, the wrangler families and atrocities committed on the reservation? What is the Chairman of the reservation back story and what drives him?

      "title": "Yes, there are Horses in Heaven",
      "content": "I've been a fan of this show since it's inception. This latest episode was an eye opener for me. Governor Dutton seems surprised that there is room for animals in Heaven. I didn't think of his character as being that detached from the creatures he depended on to sustain his earthly livelihood. I realize that this may be the final season of Yellowstone the series. I find myself conflicted in that I love the depiction of that last great frontier being sucked up and commercialized by capitalists from the west. And yet, that's exactly what happened to the indigenous peoples. And the indigenous peoples there are rooting for the Western capitalists. Irony. Still, a great TV series. Worth watching."

      "title": "They should rename it Beth",
      "content": "I loved the first four seasons, but the new season is so Beth-centric, it's lost its spark. While Beth in small doses made for a great sub plot, her brooding, anger, hate and self destructive attitude as the central character has become so annoying and tedious, I found myself cheering for Jamie to punch the accelerator and run right through her.Every time a new sub plot pops up, there's Beth to skull a vodka and storm out of the room, or sit at the table and whinge. There's still time to salvage things, but more Casey, Rip, John and the Cowboys, and less Beth, would go a long way to getting back on track."

      "title": "Desperately Needs Balance",
      "content": "Costner is brilliant. The supporting cast is outstanding. The problem is we need a rooting interest and mostly we don't like these characters very much, especially the daughter played by Kelly Reilly. She is despicable on every level. The son played by Wes Bentley is weak. The son played by Luke Grimes is the only character who gives us a chance to root. His wife, as played by Kelly Asbille, embodies all the arrogance of wokism and revisionist historians. Cole Hauser's character is a one-note thug. Danny Huston and Gil Birmingham are the bad guys of the piece but they get a real run for their money by the supposed good guys.But more than disagreeable characters, this series desperately needs some humor, some joy, some happiness. It is all negative, all the time."

If this is supposed to be a ranching dynasty, heaven help the cows!!!!Slow moving soap opera with horses, cows and Kevin Costner. I've given it enough of my time (S2E5) and I'm going back to Scandi noir or re-runs of Fitch."

      "content": "None of the characters are worth watching and this sadly applies to Kevin Costner's character as well. It's the lack of writing which makes this show a real miss.. There's barely any acting going on and you can't rely on the beautiful environment and horses to fill in the large gaps. I can't believe this show is in Season 3 and being renewed. Why?"

The initial idea of the character of Fleabag came from a challenge by a friend, where Waller-Bridge was given the task of creating a sketch for a 10-minute section in a stand-up storytelling night.\r\nCast and characters\r\nMain\r\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge as Fleabag (although never named in the script)\r\nSian Clifford as Claire, Fleabag's sister with whom she shares an uneasy relationship\r\nAndrew Scott as the priest, with whom Fleabag falls in love (series 2)\r\nSupporting\r\nOlivia Colman as Fleabag and Claire's godmother, who began a relationship with their father not long after their mother's death and eventually becomes their stepmother\r\nBill Paterson as father of Fleabag and Claire\r\nBrett Gelman as Martin, Claire's husband\r\nHugh Skinner as Harry, Fleabag's ex-boyfriend\r\nHugh Dennis as Bank Manager, approached by Fleabag for a loan (series 1; guest series 2)\r\nBen Aldridge as Arsehole Guy, one of Fleabag's love interests, so named for his taste for anal sex (series 1; guest series 2)\r\nJenny Rainsford as Boo, Fleabag's deceased best friend and business partner\r\nGuest\r\nJamie Demetriou as Bus Rodent, one of Fleabag's love interests (series 1)\r\nFiona Shaw as Fleabag's counsellor (series 2)\r\nKristin Scott Thomas as Belinda, a successful businesswoman who meets Fleabag at an awards ceremony presented by Claire (series 2)\r\nRay Fearon as Hot Misogynist, who serves as Fleabag's lawyer and one of her love interests (series 2)\r\nChristian Hillborg as Klare, Claire's Finnish business partner and love interest (series 2)\r\nJo Martin as Pam, who works at the priest's church (series 2)\r\nAngus Imrie as Jake, Martin's teenage son and Claire's step-son (series 2)\r\nEpisodes\r\nSeries 1 (2016)\r\nSeries 2 (2019)\r\nDistribution and broadcast\r\nBBC Three was the original broadcast channel for the show with a repeat run broadcast on BBC Two between 21 August and 25 September 2016. The second series was broadcast on BBC One at the same time as being released on BBC Three, by this time only available online.\r\nIt was picked up by the on-demand Amazon Prime Video (formerly Amazon Video) service and premiered in the United States on 16 September 2016. Fleabag is also available on IFC in the US. In the Netherlands, it was picked up by Net5.\r\nThe show has been remade for French television by Jeanne Herry. Titled Mouche (French for 'fly', the insect), it started airing on 3 June 2019 on pay channel Canal+. Mouche is a close remake, though set in Paris with Camille Cottin in the starring role.\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nBoth series of Fleabag received widespread acclaim from television critics, and the show as a whole is considered one of the greatest of the 21st century. At review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, both series received approval ratings of 100%. The first series received an average rating of 8.5/10, based on 42 reviews, with the site's critical consensus reading: \"Clever and viciously funny, Fleabag is a touching, wildly inventive comedy about a complicated young woman navigating the aftermath of trauma.\" The second series received an average rating of 9.3/10, based on 97 reviews, with the critical consensus stating: \"Fleabag jumps back into the fray with a bracing second season that upholds its predecessor's frenzied wit and delicate heart, replete with Phoebe Waller-Bridge's indefatigable charisma\". At Metacritic, the first series received a weighted average score of 88 out of 100, based on 19 critics, while the second series received a score of 96, based on 21 critics, both signifying \"universal acclaim\".\r\nEmily Nussbaum of The New Yorker described the first series as \"a precision black-humour mechanism, a warped and affecting fable about one single woman's existence.\" Maureen Ryan at Variety called it \"scathingly funny\", concluding that \"long after itâ€™s pulled you in with its irreverence and jokes about sex, and beguiled you with its cutting wit and messily human characters, it reveals that itâ€™s actually a tragedy\". Hank Stuever of The Washington Post characterised it as a \"funny, highly profane but surprisingly poignant dramedy\". Mike Hale in The New York Times praised the show for its \"restless, almost feral energy and its slap-in-the-face attitude.\" Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times commended its unpredictability, acting, and \"clear eye for truth that often becomes, like all good comedy, quite devastating\".\r\nThe second series received unanimous acclaim and was considered a cultural phenomenon. Serena Davies of The Daily Telegraph lauded the second series as \"a near-perfect work of art\". Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon praised its \"brilliant swan song\", finding the series's conclusion satisfying and \"well-earned\". For Rolling Stone, Alan Sepinwall wrote that the \"tragicomic masterpiece reaches new heights in its second outing\". James Poniewozik of The New York Times wrote that \"the new season feels immediately confident, if inevitably less groundbreaking. Yet it continues to push its form\". Hannah Jane Parkinson of The Guardian described the conclusion as \"the most electrifying, devastating TV in years\", writing of the second series that \"it seems as though many who either did not watch the first series, or who didnâ€™t think it lived up to the hype, have been converted\".\r\nAccording to Metacritic's aggregate of decade-end lists, Fleabag was the second-highest ranked show of the 2010s. In 2019, it was ranked 8th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century.\r\nFormer United States President Barack Obama named the second season of Fleabag among his favourite films and television series of 2019. In his annual list, which he released on Twitter on 29 December 2019, he added a small addendum with the title, \"and a quick list of TV shows that I considered as powerful as movies: Fleabag: Season 2, Unbelievable, and Watchmen.\r\nIn 2022, Rolling Stone ranked Fleabag as the fifth-greatest TV show of all time.\r\nAccolades\r\nMusic\r\nWaller-Bridge's sister, Isobel Waller-Bridge, composed the music for both series.\r\nHome media",

At review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, both series received approval ratings of 100%. The first series received an average rating of 8.5/10, based on 42 reviews, with the site's critical consensus reading: \"Clever and viciously funny, Fleabag is a touching, wildly inventive comedy about a complicated young woman navigating the aftermath of trauma.\" The second series received an average rating of 9.3/10, based on 97 reviews, with the critical consensus stating: \"Fleabag jumps back into the fray with a bracing second season that upholds its predecessor's frenzied wit and delicate heart, replete with Phoebe Waller-Bridge's indefatigable charisma\". At Metacritic, the first series received a weighted average score of 88 out of 100, based on 19 critics, while the second series received a score of 96, based on 21 critics, both signifying \"universal acclaim\".</p><p>Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker described the first series as \"a precision black-humour mechanism, a warped and affecting fable about one single woman's existence.\" Maureen Ryan at Variety called it \"scathingly funny\", concluding that \"long after itâ€™s pulled you in with its irreverence and jokes about sex, and beguiled you with its cutting wit and messily human characters, it reveals that itâ€™s actually a tragedy\". Hank Stuever of The Washington Post characterised it as a \"funny, highly profane but surprisingly poignant dramedy\". Mike Hale in The New York Times praised the show for its \"restless, almost feral energy and its slap-in-the-face attitude.\" Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times commended its unpredictability, acting, and \"clear eye for truth that often becomes, like all good comedy, quite devastating\".</p><p>The second series received unanimous acclaim and was considered a cultural phenomenon. Serena Davies of The Daily Telegraph lauded the second series as \"a near-perfect work of art\". Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon praised its \"brilliant swan song\", finding the series's conclusion satisfying and \"well-earned\". For Rolling Stone, Alan Sepinwall wrote that the \"tragicomic masterpiece reaches new heights in its second outing\". James Poniewozik of The New York Times wrote that \"the new season feels immediately confident, if inevitably less groundbreaking. Yet it continues to push its form\". Hannah Jane Parkinson of The Guardian described the conclusion as \"the most electrifying, devastating TV in years\", writing of the second series that \"it seems as though many who either did not watch the first series, or who didnâ€™t think it lived up to the hype, have been converted\".</p><p>According to Metacritic's aggregate of decade-end lists, Fleabag was the second-highest ranked show of the 2010s. In 2019, it was ranked 8th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century.</p><p>Former United States President Barack Obama named the second season of Fleabag among his favourite films and television series of 2019. In his annual list, which he released on Twitter on 29 December 2019, he added a small addendum with the title, \"and a quick list of TV shows that I considered as powerful as movies: Fleabag: Season 2, Unbelievable, and Watchmen.</p><p>In 2022, Rolling Stone ranked Fleabag as the fifth-greatest TV show of all time.</p><h4>Accolades</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><caption>Award nominations for <i>Fleabag</i></caption><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3%;\">Year</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:22%;\">Award</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:33%;\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:35%;\">Nominee(s)</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%;\">Result</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:1%;\"><abbr title=\"References\">Ref.</abbr></th></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\" style=\"background: #ececec;

      "question": "I am very interested in starting this TV series, but I saw that it was canceled. Can anyone tell me (without spoilers, of course) if the series ended with cliffhangers? Or did it have a closed ending in the third season?",
      "answer": "I'm so sorry, but yes, there are many cliffhangers. There were at least five planned seasons so there is much left for us to discover. If you would like to read the books that go by story you should read the books. To save the show please search up the petition and sign it. Also go to annenation to learn how to get involved.It's worth a watch though. The cliffhangers don't affect the completeness that is felt after finishing season 3 in my opinion."

      "question": "What then happened to Ka'kwet and her parents?",
      "answer": "The last residential school in Canada closed in 1996, that should tell you all you need to know. It's important to understand that white settlers painted residential schools as a worthwhile opportunity for Indigenous children, even though this was far from the case, and Anne with an E managed to portray this. The series showed how Residential schools were seen by people like Rachel Lynde, as a generous act to save children, as some sort of favor to god. \"God willing we will kill the Indian, but save the Child\". We see Ka'kwet's parents, Aluk and Oqwatnuk, talk about how the whites were changing everything in their society, the land, hunting, trade, these sorts of circumstances led First Nations people to have literally no choice, but to either assimilate in the way white settlers saw fit, or be seen as an obstacle in the way of their newly \"civilized society\". Neither of these options were safe options for them, as children in residential schools faced abuse, experimentation, and in many cases, death. So while we want to hope that Anne and some other good hearted Avonlea folk brought attention to these injustices and solved it, that never happened, at least not the to extent that it ended residential schools throughout Canada by any means. At best case scenario, Ka'kwet survived and was reunited with her parents, but still suffered immense trauma from her experiences, and that trauma would have been passed down to her ancestors alive present day."

      "question": "Do Anne and Gilbert end up together?",
      "answer": "At the end of the final episode, Anne and Gilbert reunite and kiss several times, implying a promise to many more kisses, despite them having to go their separate ways to university. In the original Anne of Green Gables books, they eventually get married and have 6 children, so yes, they end up together."

      "content": "This is one of my favourite shows.I loved the old version and this one is a beautifully updated version of that story. I see a lot of hate written from purist with no scope of imagination, who dislike this. However, it is about time that we accept the fact that rural 1900's Canada was not all flowers, red roads and poetry.This modern version does not look through rose coloured glasses so we can edit out what we don't want to admit (like LGTBQ people existed back then too, First Nations and African people were wronged terribly and women were oppressed) and yet while addressing these injustices it was still true to Anne of Green Gables core ideas. The love of family and friends.The chemistry between Marilla, Mathew, Anne, Gilbert and Diana is perfect and I can't think of a show that has moved me to happy tears more than they have. It is an injustice to trash this show just because it doesn't fit perfectly into the mold of the old show or book. After all Anne didn't fit into anyones mold and that is why so many people love her.I read recently that the show has been cancelled and a deeply disappointed. This show was so good at portraying a real family, with real struggles all the while keeping with what makes Anne of Green Gables so special, that I feel as though I am losing a part of mine. I will miss it."

      "content": "It is true that we never got over the cancellation of \"Anne With An E\", one of the most acclaimed series by the public over the last few years. The production, based on the book \"Anne of Green Gables\", by Lucy Maud Montgomery, was a joint responsibility of the CBC channel and Netflix.The whole plot is centered on the transformation of Anne's life, an orphan who, after years of experiencing a series of humiliations by the current social assistance system, is going to live with a single woman and her brother.The program had a strong optimistic message, especially due to the fact that the protagonist, in the meantime, not only revolutionizes her own reality, but also that of her adoptive family and everyone around her.Now, on the night of last Wednesday (22), the website ScreenRant published an article in which it commented on the reasons why the production would have been taken off the air. According to CBC executive Sally Catto, the registered audience numbers were below expectations and failed to reach the age group between 25 and 54 years - which corresponds to the broadest audience of the broadcaster and, consequently, would jeopardize its continuity.The fans, in turn, continue to cheer for the production to return on another channel or platform. We sign below and await news! It doesn't hurt to dream, right?"

She's had some hard knocks in an orphanage when her luck changes and she gets adopted. She's bright, has her own ideas, has trouble making friends, and is quite endearing. This is a rich and enriching series that you can watch together with your kids and have real conversations. Many topics, problems, problem solving and values sprinkle throughout the episodes. 19th and 21st Century have a lot in common when it comes to mean girls."

The simple route would be less dimensional school pupils, but this series brings them all into view fully formed, with great individuality.Three episodes in and I'm falling in love with the elderly couple who adopted Anne in a very real way. Geraldine James portrayal is unfolding quietly and convincingly. She is helping to complete the heart of this tale and the charm of it is that the character of Marilla seems as surprised by it as we are.What a phenomenal effort."

My love for the original series grew even stronger after reading the books and I have watched it many many times and I am a big fan of Megan Fellows.When I found this remake of the story I was pretty stoked and hoped it would do the original and the books justice. Initially I was a bit disappointed and come close to dropping it after the first episode. Happily I kept an open mind and persevered with it and after watching the 5th episode I can truly say that I am really loving it.While it may not be completely true to the books it is still very very good.Geraldine James and R.H. Thomson, both of whom I had not recognised previously do very well as Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, they had very big shoes to fill. Amybeth McNulty as Anne is quite superb, she does herself proud and like I assume she is supposed to, steals the show.This has become one of my sought after shows and I look forward to seeing it each week.8 out of 10"

You just can't help but fall in love with Anne (Amybeth McNulty), a fierce red-haired dreamer, with a beautiful soul. The writers and creators of the show have developed a modern take on our beloved \"Anne of Green Gables\" with new and old entertaining and emotional moments that fans and viewers alike can cherish. I can only hope that we (the fans) can hopefully get a season 4, because after watching the season 3 finale, it's become so much clearer that even though Anne has to spread her wings at Queen's we wish that we could be taken along the way to see the rest of her journey. Renewal or not, Anne with an E is a fierce, groundbreaking, and forward thinking show that teaches us all to be kinder to one another and notice the little things in life especially in our world today. Anne has thought me so much about myself, and I'm so glad she did. So Anne with an E will always have a little place in my heart, now and forever."

      "content": "The show is well made, acting is good, sets are nice. However, modern media has once again ruined a timeless classic by injecting it with their modern ideas and dilemmas and social issues. Don't get me wrong, a show about a young girl in the late 1800s dealing with abuse and hardship and all the struggles involved growing up in that time sounds like a great show. But it is NOT Anne of Green Gables. This is supposed to be a happy, wholesome show that teaches life lessons. Not this mangled mess. They're just capitalizing on the Anne franchise name. Another big issue is Anne's character. She is so unlikeable, cringey, manipulative and conniving. That is so wrong. Yes, book Anne lies sometimes and has a temper, but the show could not have gotten her more wrong."

This version is absolutely splendid so far. I never thought another actress could portray Anne as well as Megan Follows, but I was mistaken, as Amybeth McNulty does a phenomenal job of Anne's portrayal. The costumes, sets, and scenery is marvelous and breathtaking, and the cinematography is wonderful. Everything in this series is captured so beautifully. I am completely enthralled by the realism that has been incorporated into this story. This adaptation captures more darkness then any of the previous versions. The realism and darkness was a little jarring to see at first, but I soon found that it made for a much better gripping and realistic tale. I saw myself laughing and crying all within one installment. I'm looking forward to seeing plenty more of this wonderful series."

      "content": "It's the turn of the century in PEI. Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert are elderly siblings on their family farm of Green Gables in the town of Avonlea. Matthew is getting old and they decide to adopt a boy to help with the farming. Instead, they are given the talkative, manic, imaginative, red-haired orphan girl Anne Shirley. Anne has lived a difficult life. She befriends neighbor Diana Barry and is taken with school rival Gilbert Blythe.This is a much darker adaptation than the classic 1985 TV mini-series. The portrayal of her orphan world is very dark and quite compelling despite the popular complaints. It makes Anne's character even deeper and more real. It's also interesting that lead actress Amybeth McNulty is a gawky teen. She's a few years older than the character but she is still very much Anne. I feel the same about Gilbert and Diana. He is that nice next door neighbor boy and she is a simple trusted friend. As for Marilla and Matthew, one can't go wrong with R.H. Thomson although there have been many good Matthews. This version of Marilla comes off harder than the others which fits better her spinster status. It elevates the emotional tension between her and Anne.As for the expended story and not having read the book, I can only guess at what the creators have changed. I would definitely be more careful with dialogue that sounds too modern. I have an issue with the fire not for anything other than that it is the same concept as her saving Minnie May Barry's life. It's repeating the same story element. I actually like expanding Gilbert's story although it may have gone too far. As for the gold scam, it's a bit ill-fitting. Her drama should center on her childhood and not actual big world drama. It does lead to a good insight into the Barry family. There are many modern social issues being tackled and that is an issue of its own. It's a bit too obvious and too in-your-face. I do appreciate many of the efforts but this should be a coming-of-age story above all else. This is a really interesting adaptation."

      "content": "Spoilers Included - Appalling. This adaptation of L.M. Montgomery's novel Anne of Green Gables is appalling. Wrong in so many ways. While it does at some moments oddly verbatim use the material it states it is based on, it also rabidly changes the story, and introduces things that are heinous. I have read the original book, and also seen the \"gold standard TV movie adaptation\" starring Megan Follows. The original book is a work of \"romantic idealism fiction\" where an orphan overcomes odds and achieves, shines and is someone irresistible to love; she is presented as a brilliant girl at 11 years old, intensely imaginative, intelligent, and grows over the course of the book into a mature and remarkable near-genius level female protagonist. And where she lives, Green Gables and Avonlea, is a place of radiant beauty. And in this halcyon setting, she has her life- positive adventures and grows. In the first 3 episodes of this adaptation, she does things that are unthinkable for a smart girl like her - tells sex stories to her friends which Anne Shirley was too smart not to know to keep her mouth shut about, she had better judgment than that, whatever her famous dreaminess and distractedness, she tells Matthew to leave her alone when he comes to rescue her from homelessness at the train station in a totally non-canon invented set of scenes - an act blasphemous to the kindred spirit basis of their relationship, she is mistreated or called names by almost everyone in Avonlea miserably - actions not possible to the ACTUAL characters in Avonlea - most of whom are kind, benevolent. There is a new, unexisting, needless character in the show - the boy who helps Matthew. The boys bark at her, expressing she is an ugly dog, the girls mock her, as opposed to embracing her for her remarkable imagination and personality that brightens their life WHICH THEY do in the book. There is no HATE in the book. There is in this show. After the sex conversation, Prissy Andrews' brother attempts to beat up Anne, and she is weirdly rescued by Gilbert Blythe, which is NOT how they meet, and to Anne Shirley, the romance of that would have changed her outlook on and endeared him to her, and instead she scorns him to fit in with the girls. This is NOT Anne of Green Gables. It is a rearrangement of it putting false words in the characters' mouths, false actions into the characters' lives. Anne Shirley was not \"adopted\" by the Cuthberts and she certainly did not disrespect her real parent's memory by changing her name. As literature goes, this adaptation is blasphemy and sacrilege of a beloved novel. It's grittiness is totally out of line. If you want to make a TV show about an orphan in troubled circumstances, you can, do a new story, but don't leech off of L.M. Montgomery's immortal classic. The absurdity of a newspaper boy calling out \"Scientists predict Greenhouse effect\" hilariously tops off the ridiculous ways this adaptation tries to \"do it's own thing and modern motifs\" with a sacred life positive work of literature. All of this bad adaptation was definitely not part of anything of the material this is \"based on\" and can pollute your memories of the original book. And it's own story does not make a good original story either. Shameful!!!"

      "content": "It's really a shame having to score this series a 1/10. Season one most definitely is awesome, and the actors, the script, the scenery it all just flows, but then in season two the wheel turns 180 degrees and the show becomes an endless barrage of political correctness, which doesn't seem to fit the main actors at all. Nothing worse than watching a forced political agenda shoved down your throat."

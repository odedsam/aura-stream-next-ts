In January 2020, Netflix announced that the potential for a third season was on indefinite hold as Fincher wanted to pursue other projects, but may \"revisit in the future\". In February 2023, Fincher confirmed that the series was officially over.\r\nPlot\r\nMindhunter revolves around FBI agents Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff) and Bill Tench (Holt McCallany), along with psychologist Wendy Carr (Anna Torv), who operate the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit within the Training Division at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. Together, they launch a research project to interview imprisoned serial killers to understand their psychology with the hope of applying this knowledge to solve ongoing cases.\r\nThe first season takes place from 1977 to 1980, in the early days of criminal psychology and criminal profiling at the FBI. Cameron Britton has a recurring role in this season as notorious serial killer Edmund Kemper, who is the first to assist Ford and Tench in understanding how a serial killer's mind works. Other notable serial killers featured in the first season include Montie Rissell played by Sam Strike, Jerry Brudos played by Happy Anderson, Richard Speck played by Jack Erdie, and Dennis Rader also known as BTK, played by Sonny Valicenti.\r\nThe second season takes place in 1980 and 1981, with Ford and Tench investigating the Atlanta murders of 1979 to 1981, which included at least 28 deaths, mostly children. This is based on the real case of Wayne Williams, who was charged and convicted for the murder of two adult men but was never tried for the killing of the children and adolescents, causing mass outrage and questions over Williams's guilt as the children's cases went cold. The second season also features other infamous murderers, such as David Berkowitz, also known as Son of Sam, played by Oliver Cooper, William Pierce Jr. played by Michael Filipowich, Elmer Wayne Henley Jr. played by Robert Aramayo, and Charles Manson, played by Damon Herriman.\r\nCast and characters\r\nMain\r\nJonathan Groff as Holden Ford, a special agent in the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit (BSU)\r\nHolt McCallany as Bill Tench, a special agent in the FBI's BSU\r\nAnna Torv as Wendy Carr, a psychology professor working towards tenure at Boston University who joins the BSU.

In January 2010 the Mindhunter project was set up at Fox 21, which had optioned the book, along with premium cable channel HBO. Scott Buck was tapped to write the pilot. Fincher, who was mostly known as a director and producer in films, felt at that time that television was \"completely foreign\" until he worked on the political drama House of Cards, for which he co-produced and directed the first two episodes. When Fincher finally felt comfortable with television as a medium after doing House of Cards, Theron suggested playwright and screenwriter Joe Penhall as the project's writer, replacing Buck. In December 2015, Mindhunter was moved to streaming service Netflix, with Fox 21 dropping out of the project.\r\nIn February 2016, Netflix announced that the production of Mindhunter would be based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Filming began in May 2016, and open casting calls were held on April 16 and June 25, 2016. Episode 9 of season 1 was filmed in Moundsville, West Virginia at the West Virginia State Penitentiary. The series was renewed for a second season before its premiere on Netflix.\r\nThe character of Holden Ford is loosely based on FBI agent John E. Douglas, on whose book, Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit, the show is based. The character of Bill Tench is based on pioneering FBI agent Robert K. Ressler. Wendy Carr is a fictional character based on psychiatric forensic nurse researcher Ann Wolbert Burgess, a prominent Boston College nursing professor who collaborated with the FBI agents in the Behavioral Science Unit and procured grants to conduct research on serial murderers, serial rapists, and child molesters. Her work is based on treating survivors of sexual trauma and abuse, and studying the thought process of violent offenders. The serial killer characters were modeled on the actual convicted criminals and their prison scene dialogues were taken from real interviews. Although not explicitly stated, it is implied that the ADT serviceman seen in several short vignettes throughout the first season is Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer. This is clarified in the second season.\r\nThe musical score was written by Jason Hill.\r\nThe second season was originally reported to consist of eight episodes; however, the season ultimately contained nine episodes. Shooting took place between April and December 2018. Directors for the second season were Fincher, Andrew Dominik, and Carl Franklin.\r\nIn November 2019, a potential third season was reported to have been put on indefinite hold until Fincher finished working on his next film, Mank. Fincher plans to make five seasons. In January 2020, Netflix announced that the cast had been released from their contracts and that the series was on indefinite hold, as Fincher was busy with other projects. A Netflix spokesperson stated, \"He may revisit Mindhunter again in the future, but in the meantime felt it wasn't fair to the actors to hold them from seeking other work while he was exploring new work of his own.\" In October 2020, Fincher confirmed the series was done for now, and a Netflix spokesperson said that a third season may be possible \"maybe in five years\". The next month, some of the reasons to suspend the series were fleshed out – cost (Fincher stated, \"It had a very passionate audience, but we never got the numbers that justified the cost.\"), production (the second season showrunner was fired and eight of the scripts were rewritten), management (co-producer Peter Mavromates said of Fincher, \"Even when he wasn't directing an episode, he was overseeing it.\"), and exhaustion (Fincher said, \"I certainly needed some time away\"). In February 2023, Fincher confirmed that the series was officially over.\r\nEpisodes\r\nSeason 1 (2017)\r\nSeason 2 (2019)\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nThe first season received positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the season has a score of 79 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 96% with an average score of 8 out of 10, based on 102 reviews. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Mindhunter distinguishes itself in a crowded genre with ambitiously cinematic visuals and a meticulous attention to character development.\" The first season of Mindhunter was named among the best TV shows of 2017; it was ranked No. 10 on Metacritic's year-end list of the best TV shows of 2017 compiled from rankings by various critics and publications.\r\nThe second season was also acclaimed. On Metacritic, the season has an average score of 85 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds an approval rating of 99% based on 70 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3 out of 10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Mindhunter expands its narrative horizons without losing sight of the details that made its first season so rich, crafting a chilling second season that is as unsettling as it is utterly absorbing.\"\r\nAccolades",

Ford takes an interest in another class delving into the minds of killers, taught by Peter Rathman. Ford, who is single and living alone at the time, meets Debbie, a graduate student studying sociology. With Debbie's encouragement, Ford seeks additional education in criminal psychology. Ford is referred to Bill Tench, head of behavioral science. Tench takes Ford on his teaching classes around the country, sharing FBI techniques with local law enforcement. In Iowa, local police take offense when Ford suggests that <span>Charles Manson</span> is a victim. As Tench counsels Ford to simplify his method, the two are approached by a local detective, Frank McGraw, seeking help in a brutal case of murder and rape.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep2\" style=\"text-align:center\">2</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Episode 2\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">David Fincher</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Joe Penhall</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">October 13, 2017</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"7\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #5A0002\">In Wichita, Kansas, an ADT serviceman demands the cardboard core for empty electrical tape.

To his surprise, he finds Kemper to be highly intelligent and talkative. Meanwhile, an elderly woman in Sacramento is attacked and her dog's throat is slashed. Ford convinces Tench to accompany him during his next visit to see Kemper. Kemper describes his hatred of his mother and how he began torturing animals. At home, Debbie wants Ford to meet her mother and states her mother judges her boyfriends by their relationship with their own mothers.

The police speak with Benji's mother. Benji's mother mentions Frank Janderman, Benji's brother-in-law. Ford begins to question Debbie's sexual past. Tench and Ford discover Frank's violent past. Frank, however, does not have a pathology of a serial killer. After interviewing Frank, the police discover that Benji's relationship with Beverly Jean was not as serious as Benji claimed. With renewed interest, Tench and Ford interrogate Benji. The trio then interrogates Rose, Benji's sister, at her house. She is seen with bruises. Ocasek warns Rose that if the FBI finds out any involvement between her and the murder, she will lose her child. Later, Rose comes to the police station and admits Frank was not home during the night of Beverly Jean's disappearance. The truth unravels as Rose claims that Frank called her to Benji's house the night of the murder and she found Beverly Jean dead.

    {
      "question": "In the opening of the first episode, the verb \"section\" is used a couple of times. The kidnapper's wife says she tried to have her husband \"sectioned\". This is a UK term, isn't it -- not something we say in the US? Were the writers of this series British?",
      "answer": "\"Sectioned\" means to have someone committed, preferably to a mental hospital. From Google: Involuntary commitment, civil commitment, or involuntary hospitalization (also known informally as sectioning or being sectioned in some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom) is a legal process through which an individual who is deemed by a qualified agent to have symptoms of severe mental disorder is detained... ALSO: 5150 is the number of the section of the Welfare and Institutions Code, which allows a person with a mental illness to be involuntarily detained for a 72-hour psychiatric hospitalization. A person on a 5150 can be held in the psychiatric hospital against their will for up to 72 hours...Bear in mind that \"5150\" refers to California law pertaining to a psychiatric hold... Other jurisdictions may use different codes or terminology."

      "question": "Is it based on a book?",

    {
      "question": "Can Anyone Explain?? In Season 01 Episode 08 at 27.49 minutes They use Bittaker and Norris Tape. But Bittaker and Norris apprehended in 1979. As far as I know the plot is from 1977. So is this an innocent mistake or am I missing something here???",
      "answer": "Time moves rather quickly on this show unlike a lot of shows, M.A.S.H. for example.Yes, it starts in 1977 but by early in season 2 Reagan is President.By episode 8 of season 1 it is anyones guess what year it actually is.Considering it is not a documentary I am okay with the time line making jumps without us really knowing it. The Brian Tench character will likely give them trouble since being six in 1977 and still 6 in 1981 is less than normal."

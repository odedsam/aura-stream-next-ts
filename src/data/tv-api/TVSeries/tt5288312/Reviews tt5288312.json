      "title": "Watch the Original; Beware of the Fuller Corruptionl",
      "content": "Exceptionally well-done series. Although originally envisioned as appealing to adolescent girls, it has a universal appeal because of its authentic story-line, realistic portrayal of characters, great writing and pacing, but most of all.... its intelligence. Yes, intelligence! Skam doesn't dumb down the lives of the teens it portrays, the challenges and issues that they face, or their own intelligence and motivations. It doesn't exploit them. It treasures them. It is deeply respectful of the lives that they lead, and values their intelligence and authentic striving -- their essential humanity. It's a rare piece of television. And great stuff.How sad that the US/UK television rights have been bought by Simon Fuller. The US/UK version will undoubtedly miss all that is good and noble about this series and go right to the ratings formulas, giving us a self-absorbed, teeny bopper melodrama that turns characters into stereotypes and sensationalizes (i.e. exploits pornographically) the lives of the young people portrayed. What Fuller will do will have NOTHING to do with what this series is about. But he'll steal the rights, steal the name, and do the teensploitation. Shame on him!!Skip what will surely be the US/UK abortion. Watch the original - thanks to all those wonderful people who translated and embedded subtitles. Once you watch, you'll have no doubt that Fuller hasn't the intelligence or decency to do what's right by this series."

      "content": "Skam certainly makes me relive my teenage years all over again. Usually I'm not really into high school shows, but this is not your average high school drama at all! In fact, it actually feels more like you're watching a documentary rather than a fictional show, and that's exactly why Skam stands out from the rest. Every character is unique and you can definitely relate to their personalities and problems. You can even recognize yourself and your friends in many of the characters. What makes Skam stand out even more though, is the way its characters interact with the viewers. They're not just actors and actresses playing a role. They \"become\" the characters so to say. The show runners have done this by creating Instagram and Facebook accounts for every character, as well as posting screen dumps from text messages between the characters on the shows official website. Combining this social media aspect with the show adds something unique, that I've never seen before, hence making Skam feel much more real.Skam doesn't try to be overly dramatic nor does it try to be picture perfect. It's the perfect combination of both and it manages to stay this way all the way through. I've already binged through season 1 and 2 in no time, and I can't wait to watch more of this fantastic show! If you want to feel 16 again, I would definitely recommend this show!Good job Norway!"

      "title": "\"The\" TV Show",
      "content": "I've seen a lot of TV shows during my life (probably more than most people) and I am having serious issues finding a show that is better than this.As a 24 year old guy I am probably not the primary audience for this, but I've never once felt like I am too old for this or that this was written for somebody else. It instead made me feel nostalgic and reminded me of my high school experience, which was pretty similar to what is shown here (just with less partying). There are no classic \"jocks and nerds\" groups in this, just different groups of friends that interact with each other. I don't know if this is because the high school experience is different in Europe than in the US (where most popular TV shows are from) or something else. But it certainly felt closer to home. The first two seasons were brilliant, but season 3 felt so real that it made me cry more than once. The character of Isak could have been written after any closeted gay boy during high school. And that basically struck so close to home. I pretty much fell in love with Tarjei Sandvik Moe and his character. His acting ability at 17 pretty much makes every other actor seem like an amateur. He expresses so much emotion through his body language and facial expressions that I believed that this is actually what he was feeling.Season 4 has just started and I am going to watch the first episode after I finish writing this. Sure it probably won't be as good as season 3 (mostly because I pretty much saw myself in season 3), but I have no doubt that it will be brilliant. The main issue is - where do we go after Season 4? Season 4 is supposed to be the last one and I have serious issues finding a suitable replacement. To be honest... I pretty much lost interest in all other TV shows because none of them can compare to this."

      "title": "Norwegian series redefines teen drama",
      "content": "I discovered this amazing and unique Norwegian series, set around an Oslo high school, this summer (2017) with S3 (Isak & Even), which got more global attention and was published on more platforms and more commented on by fans because of its appealing and destined-to-be-classic gay teen coming-out love story, and then watched S1 (Jonas & Eva) & S2 (Noora & William), moving on just in time for the current, ongoing S4 (Sana) up the the end, seeing the final episode of S4 on its actual final real-time day The Eid (Eid al-Fitr ) June 25. The real-time, of- the-moment quality was essential to the authenticity of the series and its proximity to the present teenage generation. (We are told that the series was made up as it went along, with input from teens, and nobody knew during S3 who was going to be featured in S4.) Amazingly all this that I watched was not officially published but local fans' artisanal publications on various platforms with homemade but spot-on idiomatic English subtitles (including all the text messages and explanations of wordplay, maybe the best subtitles ever). It was easy to get hooked and hunt for more and more wherever you could find them. There was nothing like it ever. It was so good and these kids and their talk were so fascinating it made you study the texts and want to learn Norwegian (which I loved the sound of, but found pretty baffling). All this came at kind of a serendipitous time right after I'd devoured all but the last not yet translated of Karl Ove Knausgård's addictive 6-vol. series of autobiographical novels, \"My Struggle,\" so I was used to living vicariously in Norway.Besides being innovatively naturalistic with its real-time scenes and online broadcast, heavy use of SMS etc., it also boldly covers a social range using appropriate actors, notably Tarjei Sandvik Moe as \"Isak,\" who became a global gay heartthrob, yet was a an actual 15, 16, 17-year-old student at the Hartvig Nissens high school featured in the series. And what a compelling, watchable young actor he is! We live through his lies and dodges, double-takes and self-discoveries moment by moment. Each of the 4 seasons is the love story of one couple, all connected with the others through the school. S1 is an ordinary (cute) couple, and the boy, Jonas (Marlon Langeland of the imposing eyebrows) spoils their love through excessive jealousy of the beautiful Eva (Lisa Teige). S2 is a screwed-up couple, a snobbish, particular girl and a rich, spoiled, damaged top dog. Noora's and William's story is painful and as true as Isak & Even's. When N & W finally connect, it's super-intense, but also fragile. S3 is Isak, the gay-questioning boy who has to come out to himself, while pursued by the older, more sure Even, who yet has psychological issues. Their first dates are romantic, a scene based on Baz Luhrman's Romeo & Juliet. Then, after the requisite heartbreak and Isak's difficult coming out to his (totally accepting) pals, who sort of knew it all along, as did Emma (Ruby Dagnall), the girl he was stringing along and using as a facade, \"Evak\" wind up moving in together and being the most loving and stable couple of all, a pearl of a romance cultivated in adversity. Also interesting, a microcosm of the school social groupings, is Isak's loyal little posse of Jonas, Magnus and Mahdi and himself, who talk of nothing but sex though only one, Jonas, of S1, may know anything about it so far. Magnus is the one who has to get laid, his naive eagerness a running joke, till he finds a gf, somebody we've been seeing all along. S4, though it continues with all the former characters, focuses primarily on the most baddass and arguably the most complex and interesting character, the Muslim, hijab-wearing Sana (the excellent Iman Meskini), who as time goes on very much finds a boy she loves, Yousef, who's from a Muslim family, but sadly, her religious beliefs don't allow her to be with him when she discovers his attitude to God.The joyous party at the end both celebrates the young actor's esprit-de- corps and underlines that \"SKAM\" is throughout very much an ensemble piece, with no minor characters, because they all count, Chris, Vilde, Isak's gay roommate and scold Eskild, the bus groups, the top dog boys, everybody. Mostly to these kids, adults don't count that much, and are seen only from the neck down,except for Sana's parents, who do count for her, and the hilarious, wise school \"nurse\", more an offbeat counselor, Dr. Skrulle (Astrid Elise Arefjord), whose little scenes of quirky advice-giving are priceless. I confess to by now having watched some \"SKAM\" episodes three, four, or more times. Each time gets better and I marvel more at the wit, adorableness, and how, say, Isak and his posse play off each other when they're together. These kids are incredible. You may think of the UK series \"Skins,\" which is remarkable in its own way, but it is totally different, bent on grimness, and dark humor and absurdity, and not as real and true, or as helpful. Because watching \"SKAM\" can be healing and enlightening, as well as touching and fun. And it's basically about togetherness and love."

      "title": "I've watched hundreds of shows, this one is definitely top 5",
      "content": "Even though i'm sure there's a lot of thought process behind it, every scene from the entire season of SKAM feels so natural, even the minor details. It's not something extravaganza, overly dramatic teenage shows which most \"hollywood\" shows are. What stands out about this show is the extremely and i mean EXTREMELY well written character. There's is literally no single shallow character. And how they made every season from a different character's perspective is perfect, it made the story line more personal. It almost feel like we also experienced what they're going through. The acting, soundtrack, writer, director, pacing is extremely good (AND IT'S FUNNY TOO!).I'm gonna rate every season of Skam from least perfect to literally perfect.4th Place, Season 2 (Noora) 9.2/10 Noora is actually the best character in the series, imo. It's really hard not to like her character and it's really nice to see her full story. We also introduced to a new characters, Eskild which is the funniest guy. But what this season lack of is good pacing. It started out really well, but towards the end it feels like \"dragged down\", and the pace is really slow comparing to the first season. And William character while he's far from one dimensional, he's portrayal of a \"cool guy\" a little bit too much.3rd Place, Season 4 (Sana) 9.5/10 Sana has always been this \"badass\"character, and in this season we got to see another side of her which is cool. And there's a lot of deep ,important messages and meaning from her conversation with Yousef, and Isak. That bench scene is phenomenal. But throughout this season, Sana makes a really questionable decision, like SANA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING! I understand why she make those decisions but it's still hard to watch. But it's still really good.2nd Place, Season 1 (Eva) 9.9/10 This season got me hooked. I remember the first time watching it i wasn't expecting on getting invested, and ended up watching the whole season in one sitting. The story of Eva is brilliant. We started with feeling sorry and sympathize for her character at the beginning. And as the season progress, with the twist and turn we see that bad stuff that has been happening to her is her own doing. The fast-paced is well done. And we also introduced to the girls!1st Place, Season 3 (Isak) 10/10 Out of all season, this season is probably the most well written, and well acted. Tarjei Sandvik Moe (The guy who play Isak) is brilliant. The subtlety of Isak and Even's acting and the writing stands out the most. The writing of this season is on another level. The progression of the plot is so fast, and there's so much going on in this season. But somehow it's feels so natural, It doesn't feel forced or rushed. Isak's character is developed perfectly. And the ultimate plot twist is beyond perfect (even though it was hinted throughout the season). This is definitely on of the best season of all tv series i've ever watched."

      "title": "A fundamental show to understand our generation",
      "content": "\"Skam\" is in every sense of the word, a miracle of TV show. It really is an extremely well constructed, authentic and absorbing piece of storytelling that succeeds first and foremost because it understands youth culture, social media and characters. These have to be some of the most relatable characters I've ever witnessed in any medium, period.There is a sense of understanding and appreciation for the struggles of the various sub-cultures within the adolescence spectrum. The girls and boys talk and act like people you know where it starts to feel like you're actually witnessing real life drama taking place. This is a huge achievement by the shows creator and director Julie Andem who created a safe space for everyone to express themselves. The result is something that no other teen-show archived: drama that doesn't feel theatrical but lived in and approachable.But even when the show tries to go for a more conventional tone, whether in humor or drama, it actually made sense because within the context of its depiction of adolescence, this is how their naïveté is best translated to the screen, which is then obviously supported by a very contemporary soundtrack.\"Skam\" made me feel so many emotions and it is by far one of the most exciting fresh things I've seen in modern TV made for younger audiences. But even people who feel like they can't relate to this generation should give it a watch, it is an eye-opening experience that can possibly be helpful for understanding our modern culture."

The episodes are very short, but you get so much of that character in that short time. It's like a regular series, except they removed all the \"filler\" scenes, things like a car approaching, a house seen from far away for 30 seconds, stupid lines between people that don't matter. That's the one thing I like about this series. Very focused, very time effective, focused on feelings and characters. Also, the soundtrack is on fleek.Just give it a shot and watch the first 1-2 episodes. They are short anyway. I'm 99% sure you'll like it."

      "title": "An incredible and real approach to European youth",
      "content": "SKAM creators really know how to portrait relationships between young people on a tender yet realistic and raw way. All kind of interactions are showed on the episodes (friendship, romantic plots, betrayals, fights ). The show also displays really interesting topics such as bullying, religion, multiculturality, eating disorders or sexuality among many others. The script shows a realistic portrait not only of the Norwegian youth, but also of most European youth.The way the show is edited is great as well: The music chosen for each scene, the way the camera sometimes focuses on facial expressions of the characters because those are more valuable on certain moments than the spoken words, the close-ups of eyes, hands or smiles everything is really thought out.The first season shows Eva as the main character and introduces most of the cast we'll be watching on next seasons. Eva is dealing with many issues such as bullying, carefree parents, trust missing to Jonas, her boyfriend and her own infidelity.Noora, second season's main character is a young girl who lives with two flatmates. She is a powerful person with strong beliefs about violence, feminism and worldwide war issues, during the season she will have to deal with her values because of the person she falls in love with.Third season's main character it's Isak, who we have met before during season one and two. Isak is a seventeen year old who is dealing with his homosexuality. The way this plot is portrayed on the show it's just astonishing realistic.Gay story lines are growing more and more these days on TV shows, movies and books and I think that is fantastic. Most people fall in love with the romantic scenes, I do too, but the most interesting thing to me is discovering how the characters deal with transition to self-acceptance of their sexuality. I have always felt that those important moments about dealing with sexuality are not always represented on a realistic way when portrayed on screen or, if they are, there are not given the value they really have: Many times we just see a person trying to hide it and then boom! he or she decides to come out. There are only tiny little pieces about the struggle of dealing with self-acceptance of being gay. I feel that SKAM has managed to go beyond on that.The short clip \"Gay\" that showed Isak on his computer at 3.03 taking an online gay test and looking for tips and tricks to feel sexually attracted to girls caused a big impact on me, while watching it you can really feel that he is fighting a huge battle because he doesn't want to be who he really is. The way Tarjei Sandvik Moe portraits that little yet special moment it's just heartbreaking, absolutely wonderful.As the plot continues, we can see more and more about Isak loneliness and how he keeps pushing away everyone who cares about him just because he keeps fighting against his feelings and his identity."

The target group were initially Norwegian teenage girls, but Skam also has its share of adult fans. Actually, you don't have to be a teenager, Norwegian or Scandinavian to appreciate Skam.Here are some of the reasons that I love this series: Skam has a tight and well written storyline, as well as lovely, believable faulty characters, that really evolve during their own seasons. The shifting point of view makes us realize that \"everyone fights a battle you know nothing about\". The show has good, realistic dialogues, fantastic acting and beautiful high-impact visual scenes, we get close to the characters, also visually. At times it is as if we are them, and feel what they feel. The music is great, and fits the scenes perfectly. Skam is playful when it comes to genre and style, it has a mix of realism, drama and comedy, and it works.The series tackles important issues for the target group and the whole modern society, in a smart, straightforward and not admonishing manner. The issues the show tackles, from Islamophobia and homophobia to date rape, eating disorders and mental illness, feel authentic because they are presented earnestly. The show mirrors all of us, and lets us look at our own hidden fears and prejudices in a clever way.The fact that we can follow the characters in real time is also fantastic. Skam is pioneering in the way that clips are posted in real time online, as if its characters truly exist. Fans can interact with their favorite Skam characters on Facebook or Instagram. A new clip, Message or Insta can come anytime during the night or day. This also makes the show highly addictive. I also love the show because of all the lovely easter eggs, \"messages\" to fans and references to literature, movies, music, religion and philosophy that it provides.And finally there is the one thing that makes this show the best. It aims to reduce the kids' shame, and it uses humor to show that we all are human, we make mistakes. And it's OK."

      "title": "Why aren't all teen shows like this?",
      "content": "Light spoilers aheadThis is just great, I loved this with all my heart. I really have no idea why I call this a 'teen show', I know many much older people who also enjoyed this a lot. This isn't some melodramatic teen drama with sex, drugs and harmful portrayals of mental illness shoehorned in with adult actors so the producers can get sex scenes into the show, instead it's a rare piece of television, tackling real teenage issues with respect, and the actors are teenagers themselves, neat. Speaking of the actors, they are suprisingly good and I was never taken out of the show due to the acting, it always felt like I was a bystander, watching as the events unfolded. The characters themselves were beliavable and I really love the original format of the show being released as small clips, (thus why the large text at the beginning of each scene telling the day and date). Even soundtrack was a bop, there were only two songs I felt were out of place or inappropiate for a scene but they weren't too distracting. But what really sells SKAM is the writing, it's just great, nothing could beat how Julie wrote this show.The first season is about Eva, suspecting her boyfriend is cheating on her, worrying about russ bus and adapting to the high school life, making friends along the way. This season was melodramatic but I don't see it as a big problem, teens are dramatic and it never felt too unbelievable, like Eva wanting to change her school due to falling out with her boyfriend instead of wanting to confront him. And I love all the messages this season gave, especially that in high school, the upperclassmen don't care what you're doing.The second season is about Noora, a strong independent feminist living with her roommates, and the ''popular guy'' ends up being interested in her and despite her hating him at first, they end up becoming a couple. Some other stuff happened but I just can't remember. This season is definitely my least favorite, maybe it's just because Noora was a character I despised or that this felt like an overdramatic season.Season three really appealed to the lgbt by having Isak as the main character. Priorly he had been seen only kissing girls but this season is about him accepting his homosexuality and his relationship with Even. A fairly good season, tackling Isak's sexuality and mental illness and ot's the only season that made me cry.The last season was about Sana and her trying to live the traditional Muslim lifestyle and the traditional Norwegian high school life. This season was pretty weak but not all that bad. It was a great time to end the series despite me wanting to see the students graduate. The ending was nothing special but it was good, ending on a high note.Overall I'm happy that this show exists and it does give important messages to it's viewers. It's a shame how many remakes there are, they can never top the quality of the original and some viewers will never see the original, it's really a shame."

      "title": "Incredibly Good and Progressive Show.",
      "content": "SKAM was an experience, from beginning to end, that I firmly believe people of all ages can enjoy, though I will admit it will probably appeal most to the teenage mind. This show combines well-written characters with interesting plot lines and development to create an amazing show viewers will fall in love with. It does have its issues with a few somewhat dull scenes, including one scene that consists solely of characters eating breakfast in silence, but that can be forgiven.SKAM is the first show I've seen in a very long time that has cast teenagers to play teenagers. Not only that, but the actors are a part of the production and do get a hand in deciding things about their character. The show itself contains some great messages about standing by your friends, accepting yourself, and coming to terms with your identity, and they do it in a tasteful and realistic way. No one gets their happy ending without making a few mistakes along the way. The show does contain some themes that are often considered taboo for teenagers to do or even talk about in today's society, like drinking, sex, partying, and drugs. SKAM does a great job of portraying the teenage party scene in a realistic but still kind of tasteful way.Overall, SKAM is a great show that I would encourage most people to watch. Maybe not a show to watch with your little sibling or kid, but a good show for people over the age of thirteen."

      "title": "Fresh & Sincere Look at Teenagers",
      "content": "Skam does a wonderful job in portraying the world of teenagers with a very fresh perspective. Each season focuses on one of the main characters and takes us into a sincere journey with them with 360 perspective; their emotions, ideas, and interactions with people around them which makes you feel like you are a teenager again and even though you are from a completely different culture, you feel like one of them. It shares the essence of being a teenager in today's world thanks to Julie Andem's prior research with teenagers. The strongest aspect of Skam is the openness of characters to different cultures, ideologies, and sexual orientations. We see them doing all the mistakes that we have thought once to be the end of our lives. However, with a little help from their friends and a realistically depicted maturation, they find the strength to go on and discover some more. Skam touches upon the most important subjects in an interesting and intelligent way; religion, homosexuality, sexual abuse, discovering sexuality, building one's identity. These teenagers build the most interesting dialogues that go far beyond being politically correct. They get stronger together and stand for their rights and freedom against the most unfortunate experiences. There is no victimization but only an emphasis on strength. Each episode, there is a valuable insight you get from the main characters. They are not always right or they don't always do the right thing but they are also open to change and learn from others. It is the first time that I have seen a Muslim woman portrayed as a random human with ideas, passions, objectivity, and open-mindedness. The misunderstandings based on religious and cultural differences are also handled in a great way. Changing the lenses each season, taking a new character's perspective makes you understand the value of open interaction and accepting everybody as their selves. Unlike the American high school series, there is no vengeance and master plans, nothing is told in an unrealistic way, nothing is overly romantic; it is about the complicated, messy but purposeful process we have all been through. It's been a delight to join these teenagers' journey for four seasons and I am excited to learn more about Sana this season. After a very long time, I am happy that I found a 10 out of 10 show that takes me back to my high school years and takes me through a roller coaster of emotions."

      "title": "Best teenage drama series. Ever.",
      "content": "I found Skam when I was looking for something new to my exam-free period for binge-watching. Like normal students do. I didn't give it much hope after I read the introduction, but I thought, oh well, just give it a try.I ended up finishing all 3 seasons in 3 days.There is a lot of great things about this show, but the best is, that it is realistic. These things happen every day in schools around the world. They portray teenagers as they are: confused, angry, dishonest/honest, rebelling, in love, etc. There are two themes that made this show my favorite:SPOILER!!1. Vilde's and Noora's eating disorder. They portrayed eating disorders in a way that no TV-Show did in the past as I can remember. They never ever used the terms \"anorexia\" \"bulimia\" or \"eating disorder\". Not once. They focused on habits people do who have a battle with diseases like these. And on the support the two girls silently gave each other. If you take a look at other TV-Shows, they portray anorexic/bulimic girls as something fashionable, skipping through pages of magazines, starving themselves and throwing up to be skinny. But they don't focus on the reasons behind that and don't give a realistic picture. This show does.2. Isak's coming out: coming out is not simple and they pictured it realistically. He needed a long time to come out and they showed the side-effects that kind of fear and stress produces. They also captured the friendship between the guys brilliantly. As any normal 16-17 year olds, they had no idea how to handle their friend being gay, but they gave their best to support and understand him and that is what true friendships are about.Honestly I hope that the writers get every prize and credit, because the dialogues in Skam are more than brilliant. They are clever, on point but still teenage-like. So I would recommend it really to everyone. I'm not a teenager anymore, but I felt for every single character in this show and it reminded me of my school-time, which was a living hell. And if you have teenage kids, let them watch this. It will help them recognize things in the way they understand it. (and I am really sad, that they'll make an US Version.. I'm sure it won't be as half as good as the original one... )"

Just to get a small update, if only a transcript of a SMS- chat or message log. NRK makes the show realistic by \"hiding\" the actors (refuse media to interview them), giving every character a Instagram account and/or a Facebook account, and the \"live\" updates. This gives us, the viewers, the feeling of that the characters are real. Many, many times the actors have been called by their characters name - Ulrikke Falch gets angry by people calling her Vilde e.g.(told by people knowing Ulrikke in real life)This show have it all: strong female characters, religious character, gay characters - what more can we get?Oh, I want more of boy Chris!!"

Honestly watching this show is the best decision I've made in 2017 and it has not even been 24 hours since the Times Square ball drop. You know one of those stories where you can kinda guess what the characters are going to say next, or those in which the characters talk so fast it's too witty to be real, none of that in this beautiful TV show and it's so refreshing. I jumped straight to season 3 cause I was sceptical about the first two seasons cause I thought how original could it be..., but having finished season 3, I'm completely sold. Very interesting characters and view on numerous issues, excellent soundtrack choice..., just absolutely beautiful."

      "content": "High school is for many the defining moment for the crossover from childhood to adulthood. Its a period that has its charms and certainly its complications. \"The first experience\" for so many things happen here. You can fall in love, break up, feel jealous and insecure and will probably have your first sexual experience. Social media will shape and form these experiences with all of its possibilities and pitfalls. A very easy identified theme in many movies and series, that depicts these years, centers around the feeling of being awkward which Skam also does to a certain extent.Skam hits all of these themes spot on with a well adjusted pace, young actors that seem very comfortable in front of the camera showing emotions of vulnerability.It flirts with social drama but the themes doesn't weigh you down as a lot of humour is blended in but without betrayal.The way I see it the show have a broad appeal given its theme of young adulthood and having a gallery of so many different personalities that identification should be possible.I will recommend the story of Vilde, Noora, Chris, Eva and Sana to anyone who either have a direct of indirect connection to youth culture of today or to anyone else who has the curiosity of an anthropologist towards this theme.Regards SimonPs. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist. If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews."

Skam Norway has many remakes,but personally i think the original it's the best one.This series portrays the lives of nowadays teenagers so well,so realistically that it is insane.the acting,writing and pacing are literally so obtaining and noteworthy.though i haven't been through even half of the things that the characters go through,i can totally relate to them and see a bit of myself in every situation,decision and character.the plot and the story-line are nothing new or shocking,but the way everything is presented is so graceful. Skam is not the typical teen drama that we're all used to,it doesn't include all the spoiled popular girls,handsome f-boys and the constant gossip,but IT IS better.everything is so authentic,so naturally developed.although,i can't find a single flaw about this show,i think for a lot of people it would become annoying to watch and maybe some would even define it as \"slow-burning\".however,if you really dive deep into it and put yourself in the picture,imagine yourself in some situations and positions,i think Skam could actually become your new comfort show :)"

(this goes for all seasons but especially season 3)The whole fandom roared in anger when they changed last week's clip from 45min to 18min but then cried together in joy because the writers managed to give us so much in those six new minutes. Something most TV shows spend a whole season TRYING to achieve. I believe the reason is the friendships the show has built up and letting us see, both in the clips and also in all the social media posts. (I highly recommend checking out the social media posts over at Skam's webpage!) Because real friends push each other. So instead of spending hours of screen time where the character has to figure out how to solve a problem or move past something, the friends are there. Calling out BS, listening, reasoning, supporting. They are all growing together, and I'm so glad we get the chance to grow as well. ❤︎"

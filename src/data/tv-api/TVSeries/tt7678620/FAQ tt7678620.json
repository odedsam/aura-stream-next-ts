      "question": "Do the characters age?",
      "answer": "Well, they sort of do. Bluey's friend Chloe has her seventh birthday in Featherwand, but the birthday party was more for story purposes. Fans have also noticed the voices of Bluey and Bingo - whose identities are kept confidential but are rumoured to be children of the production team - are sounding older since season one. However the creators aren't intentionally ageing up the characters, the intention is for them to stay the same age."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do episodes crossover?",
      "answer": "There are episode crossovers between each season. One of the most obvious is the appearance of 'chutney chimp wrapping paper' in Featherwand, which we hadn't seen since Takeaway in season one."

      "answer": "They are home made, and the LUDO team confirms that the only ingredient is freshly squeezed orange juice."
